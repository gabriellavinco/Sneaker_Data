# Sneaker Data Scraping

![picture](SneakerPhotos/boxes.jpeg)

Curious about becoming a sneakerhead I decided to do some research before attempting to enter the game. This got me thinking what attributes result in a sneaker spiking in resale value? Eager to run some analysis I decided to try and find some information and data. After being unable to find a dataset of sneaker data, I decided to make my own. I am looking to improve my beginner-level data scraping skills by scraping various sneaker websites. The first one I began with is flightclub.com which has a wide variety of brands as well as types of sneakers. Right now I am only looking at Air Jordan 1's, the OG's... However I am trying to create a program that is adaptable so that I can easily gather information from whatever shoe/brand I want from this website.
