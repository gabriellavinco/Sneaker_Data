Curious about becoming a sneakerhead I decided to do some research before attempting to enter the game. This got me thinking what attributes result in a sneaker spiking in resale value? Does it have to do with the colorway? Does retail price have an impact on how high or low resale price is? Which brands resell for more/less?
