I already got my two grails in 7 adults (concords and Seattle 10s).  I never owned a Retro 1 so I’m gonna stick with what I fit most Jordan’s with.  \n",

We will see though  \n",

       "1744  Thanks for your reply, I think it's an interesting question what makes a good collab. While I totally understand the idea and appeal behind something like this I'd still argue that the rare opportunity for a store to design their own pair of shoes should be used to come up with something more un...  \n",

       "1747            For me personally I like the simplistic nature of a Club C and like it when a collab keeps that with a small stamp of brand. \\n\\nBut I see your point, as someone who paid for JJJJound Club C’s I know what over paying for a ‘basic’ sneaker feels like..just had to have the name on there ha!  \n",

These aren’t meant to be exclusive as they’re considered always in stock at Patta stores. So these would be considered like the supreme AF1s which are pretty basic.  \n",

       "2227  It's really hard to tell. You should go to a store and ask for some insoles or something. And then try on a few different models and sizes to find the right shoe. Dont force yourself into shoes that arent comfortable. Go a size up if needed, even is you may have a little room in the front then. ...  \n",
