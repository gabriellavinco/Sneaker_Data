    "# r/Sneakers Scraper\n",
    "### Out of the 630 shoes models we scraped from StockX we have created a list of the model names. This script takes the list and grabs a random sample of a specified amount (in our case 30). From there we use PRAW to grab posts from the subreddit \"r/Sneakers\" using the shoe model name as a keyword. We also grab when the post was created as well as the post ID. Then we are able to use the individual post IDs to scrape the comments section. Up to 30 comments per post were gathered. In our original sample of 30 shoes, there were only 19 which had comments.\n",
