OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,f53rvc,Where can I find these OMG!!
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,f53rvc,"Moderate, definitely should try them on if you're not used to slightly chunkier shoes"
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,f53rvc,"They weigh 150 kilograms and cost 400,000$ to wear... for twelve seconds"
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,f53rvc,"[Another](https://i.imgur.com/2GPz0Q3.jpg)

OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,f53rvc,[Full shot](https://i.imgur.com/msqczjy.jpg)
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,f53rvc,The black and dark green was nice but I much prefer the white base for it's cleaner look! You really can't miss though
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,f53rvc,They fit true to size for me
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,f53rvc,"dont worry bruh i got the reference, sucks to see so many downvotes"
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,"The Balenciaga looks amazing in this shoot, standing next to that horrific eye cancer inducing abomination of a shoe. Attention at any cost."
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,ID on the right?
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,These literally belong in the dumpster
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,These Balenciaga's totally look like some Sketcher's they sell at Costco for $19.99 IMO
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,Off-White ODSY 1000
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,Ur gonna get downvoted but I respect ur opinion
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,"This comment does, its nice to see some variety to break up the Jordan/Yeezy posts."

OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,Them things are dope af
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,One of the few Off-white shoes I like that aren‚Äôt a Nike collab
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,For sure...I like some of the OW stuff...but I don‚Äôt get all the souped up hype over them.
OFF-WHITE Odsy 1000,ehl57e,If they didn‚Äôt cost a fortune I‚Äôd happily buy a pair tbh. Same for the balenciagas as well lol
Puma Clyde Hardwood,glmuya,Mate how's the sizing for these compared with adidas basketball sneakers??

Puma Clyde Hardwood,glmuya,"I don‚Äôt have any adidas basketball sneakers :/ but I went true to size for this pair and they fit perfect, I like my basketball kicks to be snug so I got my true size which is 10, and they‚Äôre perfect"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,g5ds54,Fire
Puma Clyde Hardwood,g5ds54,Fire
Puma Clyde Hardwood,g5ds54,"Hey, bud. Quick question.  Do these run true to size? Sorry for the late response.."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,g5ds54,Go half a size higher
Puma Clyde Hardwood,g5ds54,Thanks! I really appreciate the response.
Puma Clyde Hardwood,kavgr2,"Theyre good shoes, weartesters likes them for performance too. 

&#x200B;

This is my opinion personally. I wear a lot of sneakers but for me even .5 up, my toes couldnt really move. I have a wide and tall foot so i didnt find these comfortable (i just got in a new pair .5 up just to make sure a bigger size wouldnt be better). Im probably returning them.

&#x200B;

Weartesters says the knit breaks in but im not sure how long that would take, not being able to wiggle or really move my toes is kinda a deal breaker even if they could get better with wear. (the knit seems pretty stiff on top of that they have some sort of neoprene/elastic system under the toe box attached to the tongue thats a tad stiff.

&#x200B;

Personally i think the Clyde Courts are better than the hardwoods. I have a pair of the peace on earths and theyre fantastic. I think if the toebox area was a bit better id enjoy the hardwoods but i cant wear them down for only a hope they get a tad bit more loose in the toe area."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,kavgr2,"Sorry, not much help, but I‚Äôve had my eye one them for a while.  If you wouldn‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôd be great to see what you think if and when you get em."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,kavgr2,"Good to know. I have a large foot and trying stuff on in person is tough (not to mention during a pandemic). I probably wouldn‚Äôt have got them for full price w/o a try-on, though. They‚Äôre honestly slick and I hope these work out alright for me but I appreciate the honest review."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,kavgr2,"For sure, they're coming in soon. Full review will come then lol"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,kavgr2,"No problem my dude. I got some wide/tall sasquatch feet for a short dude so finding footwear that works for me can be pretty annoying. I can deal with some things for aesthetics but being unable to move my toes crosses that line haha. If i take the insole out i can kinda wiggle them and it gives more space but that insole has a lot of comfort, not to mention wearing no insole in your shoe is never comfortable.

&#x200B;

I have a similar issue on the Asics GEL Lyte III open tongue. Cause my foot is tall the open tongue cant close and looks weird as fuck, even sizing up haha. It sucks but it is what it is. I usually just return anything that doesnt work out but it sucks that i dont have any decent shoe stores near by (not to mention a pandemic).

&#x200B;

The shoes themselves seem comfortable and are definitely well made. The suede and leather used on them is excellent and so is the knit. So if your foot can fit in them fine id say youll be a happy customer. Its a great silhouette."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,[deleted]
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"Love puma, got four pairs in rotation. I almost copped these recently. How you like them?"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"I hope your hardwoods come soon dude! I got the white and black ones. I wanted the green or pink but they didn‚Äôt have my size when I bought mine for a good price ($120 CAD shipped). 

The Halloween ones with the x-ray of the foot right? I regret not getting those too lol.
I should have grabbed the black with the purple bottoms when I had the chance but, alas, these will suffice haha.

I am a wide footer too!
Honestly, I have the OG Palace Guards and the leather and quality is amazing but...they are a little narrow.
I was surprised because I hadn‚Äôt experienced that with Puma before.
They are still fire though haha.
#pumagang"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,Been wanting the boston green Clyde Court Disrupts for a while now
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,These are nuts
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"üôåüôåüôåNice pick up as well! 
I want the RS Dreamers as my next Puma pick up!"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,All my love for PUMA. I have these and they are phenomenal.
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,Got the white and black ones of these and the white and green Clyde Hardwood. Solid performance hoops shoes but also sharp to wear casually
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,Big time 380 Alien inspiration
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,What model of pumas are these?
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"Eyy, love me some Pumas. Just picked up the Clyde x Pink Dolphin collab, and it's fuckin' sick."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,üòÇüòÇüòÇ LMAO. Right?
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,What pumas you have
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"Puma is 100% underrated and love how many you have dude! 
These are honestly my favourite shoes to wear in my whole collection. That includes my Space Jam 11s, Chicago 1s etc.
I also have the OG Palace Guards as well. 
I wish I copped the RS Dreamer this weekend.
Puma needs more respect!"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"Nice! I don‚Äôt know why the Complex crew hates these so much. They say that they were plain but...if they had a swoosh and Travis Scott rockin‚Äô them, they would have been the shoe of the year in 2018 üòÇ."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"Appreciate the love üôè.
The detailing is amazing on the feathers! I have worn these a to over the past couple years and they are showing absolutely no wear, it‚Äôs crazy the quality!"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"The detailing in the fabric for the feathers is amazing right? 
The quality on these is A1!
I also have the Clyde Hardwood‚Äôs from this year/last as well and the quality is again way better than my Nike or Jordan‚Äôs.
My Adidas are decent though haha."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,üíØ! I have the black and white hardwoods! I definitely agree they look on court and off üëå. Chris/Nightwing at WearTesters thinks so too haha
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,The 380s were inspired by these then because they released back in 2018 haha.

Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"I think i have some clyde hardwoods coming soon, depends if the poshmark seller ships or not cause its been almost 7 days, after 7 days if they havent shipped you can refund. Wanted to try them and saw a new pair for cheap so copped, just waiting one more day now.

&#x200B;

I really wanted to grab the Halloween ones from a few years back but i held off on them and now i cant find a pair. Oh well. Maybe theyll release some new halloween heat this year.

&#x200B;

I love all my puma shoes, i have a ton of them. Easily the best quality and price on their kicks, by far. You can cop their new shoes from usually 65-120 bucks, Nike/Adidas new models start off at like 120+. Plus Nike sucks cause their shoes are narrow as hell, i almost never have to worry about pumas being narrow. They always fit reasonably wide and thats why i love them especially."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,Dude I love Nightwing and Weartesters! hahaha. I got the hardwoods during quarantine so I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to play in them but I was thinking wearing them more as a casual shoe anyway. I liked the Clyde courts enough and think your color way is dope!
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,Ohhhhhh
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,Thanks!
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"Oops. I meant to post direct to you üòÇ


I hope your hardwoods come soon dude! I got the white and black ones. I wanted the green or pink but they didn‚Äôt have my size when I bought mine for a good price ($120 CAD shipped).

Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"Ya dude, I have been watching Nightwing for years! He is super honest and just loves sneakers no matter the hype. Probably why he doesn‚Äôt have a million subscribers lol.
I wear my Hardwoods casually as well right now.
When it‚Äôs safe sometime in 2021 and indoor courts open up, I want to test them out for sure!
Thanks dude üôè.
Like I said, this is my favourite sneaker in my collection so I appreciate the love üëç"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"Hell yeah. Yeah theres a few models i know dont fit but everything else virtually is wide friendly. I know the baskets dont or the suedes, for me at least. Or else i wouldve bought the cow suedes. 

Its crazy how slept on puma is. I have a Chinatown Market x PUMA Flames hat, i had two. Dude at Planet Fitness thought it was fire too, first time anyones asked me about the hat so i gave him the one i had on ice."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,i4d2nv,"That‚Äôs a cool thing to do dude! I am sure he was pumped to get the hat.
They just need 1 big co-sign and 1 big athlete to take them to the next level.
Jay-Z needs to start pulling from the RocNation athletes catalogue üòÇ."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,gp8y97,Saw the Puma love on here yesterday and wanted to share my newest pickup. Caught these bad boys on clearance and am debating picking up the Hardwoods and Legacy 68‚Äôs too. For their first couple shoes I‚Äôve loved what pumas put out so far.
Puma Clyde Hardwood,gp8y97,"I‚Äôve got the Clyde Courts too and I only played two games and shot around in them before lockdown, but they felt great. Got them on the low too, and then I bought some Clyde Hardwoods on sale too. When things open up I can‚Äôt wait to try them both out again. I‚Äôm a big Nike guy when it comes to hoops, but I‚Äôm in love with Puma Basketball right now."
Puma Clyde Hardwood,gp8y97,"Haven't been disappointed with any of my Puma shoes, and the price is always SO right on em üòç"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,gp8y97,"That‚Äôs awesome man, I‚Äôm glad you liked them too! I got a solid year and a bit out of the courts and they were my first basketball specific shoe! I‚Äôm a broke college student so I had to wait awhile to upgrade, but can‚Äôt believe how many people sleep on Puma!"
Puma Clyde Hardwood,gp8y97,"Puma‚Äôs sales are underrated right now. As for their shoes, people say they want something different but won‚Äôt step outside of Nike or Adidas, but it‚Äôs fine, they can sleep!"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lvheia,üî• I hit this morning on these. I have the lifestyle so this completed it for me.
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lvheia,"Good pick up. Yeah good to be able to get a Yeezy for a change. I was able to get my frozen blue in store, discounted. Same with most 380"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lvheia,"Nice, this is my first BSKTBL pair so it‚Äôs cool to see the differences in person. This is by far my fav yeezy model so glad they have zero hype!"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lvheia,"Maybe dumb question, but are there any differences between the lifestyle and basketball models?  I know the basketball models have less 3m and a different cage, but are there other differences?"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lvheia,"I‚Äôm not sure about everything but, the BSKTBL shoe has more of a stiffer midsole and the ankle collar is slightly different. There are some videos online that point out exactly what all the difference are. I thought it was just the 3m too but comparing them to Bariums and Frozen Blue there is more variation then I thought but nothing major."
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lvheia,"Awesome, thanks so much for the info!  I appreciate it"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lvheia,"No prob, u r welcome"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,Bsktbl is on the left
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,I don‚Äôt see any shoes
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,"Nice, was thinking of getting the basketball version. I thought I went tts with my teal blue QNTMs but I got some good heel slippage. How's sizing for you? Wondering if the basketball version would solve that issue for me."
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,I found them to be tts
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,It's the right actually
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,I always go up half a size cause I have wide feet. But there is plenty of space for me and doesn't feel too narrow personally. I thought they felt really good on foot
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,For real? I thought the bsktbl has additional plastic caging.
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,I honestly can't tell you what is different cause they are so identical. Only thing I could feel was different was actual on foot the BSKTBL is more snug and your ankle is cushioned so much more
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,"I don't see the point of releasing 2 shoes that are so similar.  At least the previous version, the Lifestyle has no rubber cage and extra 3M."
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,"Yeah, that's what I've read. I haven't tried/seen a bsktbl pair in-hand. 
Expensive decision to cop both."
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,kje2tf,Well I thought given this year I'd treat myself and see if I notice which one I'm wearing üòÇ
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,I got 4 pairs total. About to get the QNTM BSKTBL next week. One of my favourite silhouettes of the past 5+years. Idc idc idc.
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,"I have the teal quantums, definitely my top 5 fav shoe right now."
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,Got these coming in today i‚Äôm so excited
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,where'd you get these from?
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,Best yeezys
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,"Dope shoe, can't stand the sued toebox, way too flimsy"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,"Damn that's a lot! I've got the OGs and Bariums and love them too, going to try to get my hands on the Flame Orange joints too, those are beautiful"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,Is there a new drop for the bsktbl?
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,teals are so underrated
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,Copped on StockX
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,Flame orange looks unreal. Thought I was the only one.
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,"The flora tings are hot, still. There‚Äôs an image of so pastel ones, lifestyle and bsktbl that look mad. Kind of yellow, blue and green pastel."
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,First or second weekend of March at select boutiques and potentially Yeezy Supply. Not sure the exact date but that‚Äôs 90% confirmed.
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,For sure. Do you like the new colorway for the quantums that is about to drop in March?
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,[removed]
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,Original QNTM BSKTBL restock **
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,"i love them they‚Äôre so cute, the qntm is honestly the best yeezy silhouette imo"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,"Uh, why?"
Yeezy QNTM BSKTBL,lreoja,I agree. Quantums are my fav followed by the 700v3s.
Adilette 2,lb0j78,Depends how you imagine your Jordans fitting - by your logic I would pick a 9.5 because I like to lace my Jordans up and look fitted. If you want them loose and a more casual fit then you should be looking at a 10.
Adilette 2,lb0j78,I would Recommend going true to size with Jordan 1‚Äôs a half size can drastically change the fit and feel imo plus it saves you on excess creases. I normally go a half size up with the adidas because I don‚Äôt like the crammed feeling I‚Äôm my toes especially if I‚Äôm running. Food for thought.
Adilette 2,lb0j78,I go between 9.5 or a 10 in Jordan 1s. In a perfect world I'd be 9.75. I have a narrow foot. 3s and 4si have to go 9.5. 1s i can get away with a 10. Is your foot narrow or wide?
Adilette 2,lb0j78,If I go for 9.5 will they feel tight almost uncomfortable on the toes? Are there chances  my toe nails get hurt if ever I forgot to cut em?
Adilette 2,lb0j78,Accidentally went half size up took a while for me to grow into them
Adilette 2,lb0j78,"That‚Äôs the thing though, doesn‚Äôt going true to size make the shoe feel tight? I probably got away with AF1 only because it ran big."
Adilette 2,lb0j78,Sorry for the late reply. Yes I believe I have a wide feet.
Adilette 2,lb0j78,"I wear a 10.5 in most Jordans- I have a J8 in a 10 which is fine, but J1 lows in a 10 are excruciatingly tight. 

I have the light smoke grey high 1s in a 10 and they for fine - if I force my foot forward in them I can touch the end, but my other 1s in a 10.5 laced tight fit fine without my toes squashed. 

TL;DR - I‚Äôm fairly sure my TTS is 10.5, and 10.5 J1s are perfect for me."
Adilette 2,lb0j78,Go 10s
Adilette 2,lb0j78,"I might for 9.5, it‚Äôs my first pair anyway. Hope it fits well.ü§û"
Adilette 2,lb0j78,Do you think the 10s fit like my AF1 9.5US?
Adilette 2,lb0j78,"Not sure where you‚Äôre based, but maybe try for a less hyped mid first? If that works in a 9.5 then you should be good with a high like that."
Adilette 2,lb0j78,i think af1s run big in my experience
Adilette 2,bf7fsb,No but i have the cloudfoam slides and they. are. the. SHIT!  Best $12 ive ever spent.  Fuck flip flops to eternity.
Adilette 2,bf7fsb,The cloudfoams I bought are fantastic. Super soft.
Adilette 2,bf7fsb,Weird. I'll return these then. Doesn't make sense.
Adilette 2,8x5193,"Man I personally don‚Äôt know

For slippers I wear these dollar store slippers. They‚Äôre sole has this stiff jelly material. It‚Äôs awesome"
Adilette 2,8x5193,Cloudfoam is legit just as comfy as Boost.
Adilette 2,8x5193,No boost but I own a pair and they‚Äôre comfy as hell
Adilette 2,8x5193,"I am intrigued. What kind of material? I‚Äôve been looking for new indoor comfy slippers since the crocs I bought from Christmas is slowly decaying. Plus they stink when I wear them bare feet in a sunny day. Which is the worst part... I‚Äôve tried washing them with not as much luck in these hot days. :(

Thanks for your response!"
Adilette 2,8x5193,"That‚Äôs good to hear. I might get them then if I can. I haven‚Äôt found them for retail yet which confuses me. Didn‚Äôt know they were so popular.

Thanks :)"
Adilette 2,8x5193,"I‚Äôll get them if I can them. 

Thanks man man"
Adilette 2,8x5193,"Dude my doctor wears these super comfortable crocs. It‚Äôs got these nub things on the heel. He swears by them. He comes in wearing his dress shoes. Then switches to the crocs

Go look for em. But wear them with socks LOL "
Adilette 2,8x5193,Lmao many thanks man. I‚Äôll try!

Puma RS-Dreamer,m4o9ph,"Puma does some really good job on these collabs, what do you think about future rider Nes?"
Puma RS-Dreamer,m4o9ph,I appreciate that you said you‚Äôre not a sneaker head; you just like shoes. Same.
Puma RS-Dreamer,m4o9ph,Where did you get these?
Puma RS-Dreamer,m4o9ph,"Was conflicted myself on which to purchase.

Sunshine was one of the first Mario games I ever played, and my all time favorite. Galaxy probably comes in as my second favorite Nintendo game, with yoshi‚Äôs island coming in third.

In a perfect world I‚Äôd have both the Sunshine and Galaxy shoes."
Puma RS-Dreamer,m4o9ph,"Just looked them up. They‚Äôre sick, I could wear them with anything, however, I‚Äôm always nervous about white shoes. But tbh i am nervous about any nice shoe"
Puma RS-Dreamer,m4o9ph,"Puma online store! I had to call their customer service in November to figure out they were having a restock mid-January ish. I just waited till then and checked the website everyday.

I also saw a decent amount of them on eBay (back in January). They‚Äôre a recent enough release I don‚Äôt think they should be too hard to find on eBay etc."
Puma RS-Dreamer,j1p0z5,These are fresh!
Puma RS-Dreamer,j1p0z5,I guarantee Kuzma and Danny Green will be wearing these.

Puma RS-Dreamer,iqlp1j,"Damn just looked them up, those are way nicer.  I'm gonna need the 64s instead though just for nostalgia."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iqlp1j,I have mixed feelings about the sunshine‚Äôs and galaxies. I‚Äôm excited but my wallets not

Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,Anyone who ordered from Footaction have you gotten a shipping confirmation yet?
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,"How narrow or wide are these? I have a ton of problems with getting shoes as my feet are wide, so alot of these styles or yeezys are too narrow for me. :/"
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,beautiful
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,"Also as far as sizing goes, id say true to size. Between this and the PUMA Clyde Hardwood, id say this fit perfect, where the Clyde Hardwood fit pretty tight if you have a tall foot due to the Knit used being a bit more firm and the locked down tongue (elastic bands holding the tongue in place).

I have to say as far as the comfort on these goes, its pretty good. I was not expecting the sole to be this thick, to me it seems even thicker than the Thunders and the RS-X. I believe the entire Midsole is their newer Profoam too, real good stuff."
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,"Nice man, i originally wasnt going to go for em but i knew if i didnt id never get them later on so i just got them. Super dope, clean, minimal. Video game sneakers are always hit or miss, these ones are super wearable and have just the right amount of design on em."
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,"Same.  Got my shipping notification already, expected delivery on Thursday."
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,"They released a few days back on the 4th, announced barely a day before hand on the 3rd for the 35th Anniversary of Super Mario Bros. Nintendo dropped tons of other news that day as well. Theyre sold out everywhere im pretty sure except in kids/toddler sizes as far as i am aware."
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,"Just curious, did you ever get that confirmation?"
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,"Yeah I know, I can't find them anywhere :( Did u get em on the 4th?"
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,Nope it got cancelled but they‚Äôve been going in and out of stock a lot lately and I was able to get 2 orders in and so far I‚Äôve gotten 1 confirmation.
Puma RS-Dreamer,inq9ea,"Yep! Got em on the 4th, shipped to me super fast with free shipping, got here today."
Puma RS-Dreamer,mp61ce,Jealous
Puma RS-Dreamer,mp61ce,Great pickup üî•
Puma RS-Dreamer,mp61ce,"Missed out on these when they first released. My local Finish Line restocked on them last week. Couldn‚Äôt pass up on these. Very dope sneaker, and very comfortable."
Puma RS-Dreamer,mp61ce,Thanks!
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,Dope . They all glow or only this color way  ? Have these released ?
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,Woah
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,"Absolutely stunning, if there‚Äôs a pair of sneakers I‚Äôd like to get my feet in by the end of the year it‚Äôs those! 
Can‚Äôt find any info anywhere on them either"
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,I don't see one in that colorway anywhere.
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,these look like customs
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,"Sick! I reay want the NES Future Riders, but I've never bought fancy sneakers before. Do they sell out online in a matter of minutes to mostly scalper bots? Is there a store in the US where they'll stock these on the shelves? Thanks for any tips, I'm clueless!"
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,Anyone seen any updates on these dropping in the U.S.? I'd kill for a U.S. men's size 13 to complete my collection of these but I missed out on some StockX pairs and now there aren't any left in my size.
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,I have all the shoes so far but this one is stunning
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,I only know if this colorway that glows. I think they are dropping in 11/27 stateside
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,üòÉ
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,Puma release calendar.
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,"Yeah, it will probably be released as a colorway instead of a separate product,but they might flip things over as the galaxy pair seems to be in demand. For now, just keep stalking that Launch Calendar."
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,Thanks ! These will make the perfect Christmas gift for someone close to me. Assuming I can track them down .
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,So nice. Any idea if they release outside the states?
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,They‚Äôre not on it from what I can see where I am (uk) got a link though?
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,"No problem and sorry for the typos. 

You might wanna keep an eye on the Launch Calendar on Puma's website. Clyde, RS Fast, Dreamer Sunshine, Future Rider and this pair from the Mario collection will all  drop on 11/27. Also, NES Future Rider drops on 12/4."
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,"Pretty sure the dates are marked for a global drop. However, all countries may not be getting them. Best to check Puma website relevant to your country and region. Hit the Launch Calendar to seethe exact date."
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,"https://us.puma.com/en/us/launch-calendar

That is US though.  Hope you guys get em over there."
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,Idk if these are region exclusive because I couldn‚Äôt find that particular colorway listed. All the others but not this . I‚Äôm in the US.
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,Will do thank you! I was looking forward to the OG CW but they never dropped here.
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,"Thanks, and yeah me too. Only can find the ‚Äúsunshine‚Äù CW on that link for them, as said elsewhere her though maybe just be released as a cw alongside that"
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,"I know. Saw that it is not mentioned in the calendar. The Sunshine colorway is launching so the Galaxy cannot be far behind.

It could get tricky because they are simply calling them white (sunshine) and black (Galaxy) colorway. The listing might happen as a colorway instead of a separate product."
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,I've been told that some kind of legal or contractual issue is holding up the release of the Galaxy cw in the US. That's why only the Sunshine is shown on the launch calendar. I don't have any further details.
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,That's weird. They just went live on Puma India's website
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,im still waiting for these
Puma RS-Dreamer,jysjgr,I'm still waiting too. I don't think they'll release now though
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"I kinda want to start visiting this sub and getting into sneakers again, I left when it turned into all Yeezyz. These are hard though. üî•"
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"I just got mine today, I don‚Äôt find them that comfy, and the back of the heel is high and rubs on the back of my upper heels. I get these are b-ball shoes though, great lockdown when laces are tight, but to wear casually with the laces a little loose I think they will rub too much, maybe I need to break them in.  I wear them because Mario haha."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"These are so clean, glad puma is finding their lane"
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,How‚Äôs the fit/sizing compared to what you typically wear? True to size or size up/down?
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"Pretty sure this isn't a J.Cole collab, wasn't that just the first colourway and not the shoe itself? Love them though!"
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"Thank you! These sure look fresh and I love what J Cole did with the silhouette itself. 

I have seen a bunch of NB, Asics, Puma posts on this sub. Let's keep it going üòä"
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"I‚Äôm surprised to read this, but it makes sense we all have different shaped feet. 

These are so comfortable for me I can‚Äôt wait to wear em again. 

The shoe laces are a bit short, but I‚Äôll probably skip the last loop to tie them better."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"Thanks! I love these.

It's been a long time coming. Rihanna's signing changed everything. She alone was responsible for 20% boost in sales. After that, there was no looking back."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"Considering it is a performance shoe, it will be snug in certain areas. I went true to size and they fit me really well. I am a US10 in Nike as well if that helps."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"I had the exact same question/doubt when this shoe came out but then I looked at a bunch of media outlets and found out that the entire RS Dreamer series is J Cole. House of heat, hypebeast, solecollector and several others reported it as ""J Cole's RS Dreamer gets a super mario Collab""

Yahoo Sports reported ""Puma and Nintendo reimagine J.Cole's shoe to celebrate Super Mario's 35th Anniversary""

The shoe is not from Puma's archive and Cole is signed to Jay Z who works as Creative Director of Puma Basketball. I connected the dots and the likelihood of Cole getting his own shoe line made more sense."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,The shoe silhouette itself belongs to J. Cole
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"I think I need higher socks like yours in the pictures, they are comfy they just were rubbing, I think longer socks will fix that problem."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"That‚Äôs good to know, I appreciate the info bro! What‚Äôs comfort like on these?"
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"This is correct, this is J-Coles official shoe from PUMA."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,Any set of thick cotton crew socks might fix the problem like you said. I found them quite comfy too and yes the laces are a bit short.
Puma RS-Dreamer,iuiovi,"They are quite comfy but being performance shoes, you might need the right set of socks to get the best out of them if you are gonna wear them casually"
Puma RS-Dreamer,iohvyl,I‚Äôm glad I went with the red Mario one. Not feeling these 2 as much.
Puma RS-Dreamer,iohvyl,"Alright now I'm listening Puma, that first pair was trash but this Galaxy one is speaking my language."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iohvyl,I'll buy the game first then the shoes if they sit.
Puma RS-Dreamer,iohvyl,"Look nice but pretty generic, couldn‚Äôt even tell they‚Äôre Mario if it wasn‚Äôt for the name up front."
Puma RS-Dreamer,iohvyl,"I'm actually very into the Sunshines, but that's also my favorite video game of all the. Nice snag on the 64s!"
Puma RS-Dreamer,iohvyl,They are doing a pretty good job capturing the essence of the different games. Hope you get to pick those up real soon!
Puma RS-Dreamer,lsr2jl,"Honestly, it doesn't matter if you have or don't have ""hyped"" shoes. You can easily contribute to the conversation by knowing about them and giving your opinion. You don't need to own any. If it were the case, the conversation would be very short."
Puma RS-Dreamer,lsr2jl,"We can see that the RS-Dreamer Super Mario 64 is selling 42% below retail on StockX, while the [RS-Dreamer Super Mario Sunshine](https://stockx.com/puma-rs-dreamer-super-mario-sunshine) is a bit more valuable and sells for 33% over retail with 188 sales.

So, neither of these are super rare/hype/valuable. But you should be proud of owning them and showing them off anyway."
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,Shoes will widen in width not in length. If the length is too short get  larger size
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,"I think you should‚Äôve gotten a size 10, because when i get shoes in women‚Äôs sizing i add 1.5 to my usual size."
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,"I'm a dumb dumb. Does the fact that it's scraping the back of my foot mean it's too short?

And also will my toes eventually widen the shoe and fit comfortably if I wear them enough?"
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,"I was thinking about that.

Would getting a 10.5 be overkill or would it be good just to be safe?"
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,Back foot scraping is mot necessarily that it is too short. It could mean that the back height is too short for your foot in that case a larger size should fit better. Is it scraping so your foot keeps liftng out of the shoe? It depends if your toes are getting squished from just from the sides or the front as well. The material its made of will effect stretch too.
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,"My foot fits snugly in the shoe as I walk. My heel just moves a bit up and down with every step, which causes the shoe to rub my Achilles tendon. Would wearing long socks and tying my shoes tighter be enough?

My toes are getting squished from the side, so I guess that will get better as I break the shoe in more. The upper is made of textile + leather, the lining is made of textile, and the sole is made of rubber. Do you think the shoe will be able to stretch enough?

Thank you for your help already. I really appreciate it."
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,"No worries, if I was you I'd go up a size to have the shoe be comfy from the get go. Socks may help. Leather has more stretch one way than the other patterns are placed so that the stretchier axis is parallel to the width thats why leather can stretch and mould to the foot. The textile may not do that so tbh if I was you I'd just go up a size. Especially if you have a wider foot and its a narrower shoe. But try wearing it tighten the laces and see. Its your decision after all"
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,"Just for clarification, is a size up from 9.5 10 or 10.5?

Either way, thank you so much for your help. I guess I'll just wear my shoes for a month and see if they're still problematic."
Puma RS-Dreamer,ivit6h,Hard to say you could look at sizing online but oft sizing is length and not width so hard for me to say really
Puma RS-Dreamer,idvli8,I am 11 in Nikes and had Puma RS-X which fitted perfectly so I would go a size up (there is no half sizes in Pumas I think)
Jordan 8 Retro,c5xrmx,Fresh
Jordan 8 Retro,c5xrmx,Do these come with a card? It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve got some J‚Äôs with a card in the box.
Jordan 8 Retro,c5xrmx,Thank you.
Jordan 8 Retro,c5xrmx,I came up short on the card as well my man. How does that even happen?
Jordan 8 Retro,c5xrmx,"Not how, but why?"
Jordan 8 Retro,c5xsuf,They're beautiful
Jordan 8 Retro,c5xsuf,These hard af!
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,I got the slides I wish I could get the real shoe 
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,I wanted these since I was young and I ended up getting them in 2013. I love the shoe. Older Jordan heads like to make fun of me because they're silly? Fuck that I love them they look so awesome.
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,why didn't i cop these?!
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,ID on the pants? They look comfy af
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,"I don't think I've seen an ugly color way on the 8's. These are straight heat. I Barely see these compared to aquas and chromes, every one has aquas and chromes. I might need to cop a pair of those."
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,grails. acquired back in 2012 and i love seeing them up. i feel as if they don't get as much love as the playoffs or aquas. 
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,My favorite shoe of all time. I have never owned a pair. I'm saving up for the playoffs after the holidays cool down. Flight club wants $300. Ugh.
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,wish i could get the slides haya
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,"I have no clue, some of the older heads seem to frown down upon newer heads. I began collecting in 2012 when I turned 18 and it was truly possible to begin. "
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,"These were definitely sleepers. Lots of people passed. Quality is pretty dreadful to be honest. Probably the worst leather in my collection, but I like the colorway too much to pass. "
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,South Pole SP Active joggers. They're quite comfortable.
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,"They're my favorite colorway, would like to get more 8s later on though. Just beware quality and potential craftsmanship issues on these. I got lucky on no major craftsmanship issues, but quality is pretty dreadful. "
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,My favorite 8 colorway. Glad you were able to get you self a pair!
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,Lmao
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,"> South Pole SP Active jogger

Thanks. Looks like they're $20 on Amazon.ca. Might pick em up"
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,"Good price, I'd say go for it! "
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,How's the sizing? I'm 5'10 145lbs. The sizing seems weird according to the reviews
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,"I'd recommend medium, my only issue is they're a little looser than I'd prefer around my thighs compared to the fit around to calves and ankle. "
Jordan 8 Retro,5d6iie,Thanks!
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,Favorite shoe ever.  Nice pic. 
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,I'm starting to recognize you by your üî• sock game. Great collection of kicks as well!
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,"These were my first pair of J's
love these"
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,My favorite colorway of the 8s! Thank you!
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,Appreciate it! üôå
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,Recognize him from his tight and short pants
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,"Love the colorway, quality could be much better unfortunately."
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,I got them when in  2013
Jordan 8 Retro,5ztcae,"Nice! They dropped in I think April of that year? I remember grabbing them a few hours after they released in store, which at the time was a rarity it seemed like. "
Jordan 8 Retro,3umyc1,Any problems picking these up on release day?
Jordan 8 Retro,3umyc1,"Damn wish I was down south lol, all sold out up in Ma. Smh"
Jordan 8 Retro,3umyc1,"I copped for my Bro at footaction, while doing my black friday shopping..no problems"
Jordan 8 Retro,3umyc1,"None whatsoever. I won the Nike raffle online, went into Nike Lenox in Atlanta, and easily picked them up. "
Jordan 8 Retro,3umyc1,Footlocker still has them in stock online. 
Jordan 8 Retro,3umyc1,Cincinnati here.  went to local Dicks at noon bought a pair of tens that I got home and decided I wanted a 10.5....went back to store at 8 pm and swapped them out for 10.5
Jordan 8 Retro,3umyc1,Crazy how widely available these are. 
Jordan 8 Retro,1cr8pu,Copped today too! My bank account is depleted once again! 
Jordan 8 Retro,1cr8pu,I'm really regretting passing on these since these are my favorite colorway for the 8s. I'll try some of my local places to see if they have any sizes left.
Jordan 8 Retro,1cr8pu,Pretty much all the money I had saved was wiped out too haha.
Jordan 8 Retro,1cr8pu,"I went release day later afternoon and was able to get my size, you should check."
Jordan 8 Retro,1cr8pu,If you have no money you should of waited for the grapes!
Jordan 8 Retro,1cr8pu,thought about it but there are plenty of other fives coming out this year that I would rather have over grapes.
Jordan 8 Retro,1cr8pu,Hows the quality on these?
Jordan 8 Retro,1cr8pu,"They're good quality, very little glue marks. Overall good quality shoe"
Jordan 8 Retro,1c9ujc,"I have a pair, love them!"
Jordan 8 Retro,1c9ujc,What colorway is that?
Jordan 8 Retro,1c9ujc,You wear jeans to work out? Nice 8's
Jordan 8 Retro,1c9ujc,"White, anthracite, dark-orange. Nice kicks calls them the ""black toe"""
Jordan 8 Retro,1c9ujc,Lol I'm just at work not working out
Jordan 8 Retro,1c9ujc,Cool. When did they release? I've never seen them before.
Jordan 8 Retro,1c9ujc,I think it was late 2007. I got mine in 2008. 
Jordan 8 Retro,1k37i8,Aquas all day
Jordan 8 Retro,1k37i8,Aqua
Jordan 8 Retro,1k37i8,Aqua
Jordan 8 Retro,1k37i8,Grapes
Jordan 8 Retro,1k37i8,Aquas if you can get them for a good price. 
Jordan 8 Retro,1k37i8,Grapes. 8s are cool too though.
Jordan 8 Retro,1e8p4o,"Any hype behind these? I'm looking for a shoe that isn't gonna be hyped out like the grapes, and these are catching my eye
"
Jordan 8 Retro,1e8p4o,"Nope, none zip nada. Funny fact the Bugs Bunny8s are still sitting at my local champs. So you have a good chance"
Jordan 8 Retro,1e8p4o,Fuck really? I can't seem to find them around here.
Jordan 8 Retro,1e8p4o,I'll peep the store if you want?
Jordan 8 Retro,1e8p4o,"Thanks man for the offer. They aren't really on my list of shoes I'm just surprised that they didn't go. I'll check mine for some, I gotta go for some shoe spray protecting stay fresh spray shit"
Jordan 8 Retro,1e8p4o,"Word I saw that shit I'm action at my local hibbett, that stuff is crazy good, definitely picking that stuff up"
Jordan 8 Retro,1e8p4o,"Its whatever they cary, normally allows the dirt to sit on top of the shoe and a wipe odf works"
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Woke up to an L from END. Nature is healing.
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"I don't know about *you* guys, but *my* chance at sneaker glory is only moments away."
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Stinks being in the west for these. First thing you do on a Saturday morning is take an L. You east coasters at least can get in a nice breakfast or a run before your dreams are shattered.
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Anyone else find it cute to see all the gamers losing their minds over having to enter raffles and shit for consoles? At least those will literally restock forever if you are just patient...
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,First time using SNKRS app. Pending for 10.5. Fingers crossed.
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Damn. I got fucked by Nikes ex-VP‚Äôs son again
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,SNKRS is like an abusive ex that you hate but can‚Äôt stop yourself from giving another chance
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"it‚Äôs crazy, you can see exactly who comes in here for resale

Pending? Immediately sold out on SNKRS?"
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"""... Don't leave. You could lose your spot in line, and that would be sad.""

Sadder than staring at a floating bag for 15 minutes and continuing to do so even though i know theyre long sold out?"
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,So how many Nike exec's kids are gonna get the W this morning?
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"Team pending!  The 8 minutes of my day where I have hope.

Edit: hello darkness my old friend..."
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Every Sneaker drop the same. Anxiety and anticipation weeks and moments til release. Up to 10-15 of scrambling and panic. And 2-3 hours of denial and numbness after the L lol
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Has anyone actually got a 10.5 or is everyone in pending
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Got a W in 8.5 for snkrs
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,i think my SNKRS app is going for the record for time spent pending
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"After 1.5 hours, I am still just moments away from the glory"
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"$1,400 checks just passed Senate. Resale on these gonna go up even more"
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Well at least my chance at sneaker glory is still moments away...
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,IVE NEVER GOTTEN PAST THE FINISH LINE OR JD QUEUE ON A RELEASE IN THE PAST 3-4 yrs
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"crazy that i can‚Äôt even fucking look at stockx because so many people are flooding the site trying to dump the shit they just copped 

haven‚Äôt gone for a big release in a year or so, i didn‚Äôt think shit had gotten this bad lol"
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,I‚Äôm just a young boy with his credit card trying to buy some shoes. But they don‚Äôt want my money üò≠ /s
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Dormammu I‚Äôve come to bargain... L
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Closed and reopened the app 4 times and still pending. Just end it already
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,I don‚Äôt even know why I manually cop when these sites think I‚Äôm a bot anyways.
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,I‚Äôve entered so many raffles and have both mine and my girlfriends phone for the 10am drop but I already know I‚Äôm taking Ls across the board. I want these so bad but am already bracing to pay resale.
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"I cant believe I hit, these and the unc 4s are the sneakers I wanted most this year and I haven't hit on anything since early 2020"
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,"I wish there was a way to find out the average age of the SNKRS accounts that are winning these days. I see a lot of people saying they haven't won in years, etc. There could be something to that."
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Hebert family got the W though.
Jordan 8 Retro,lyyqj1,Is everyone pending on 10.5?
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,Keep saving.
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,are you going to wear them or r they for display
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,In my opinion the ROTY are one of the cleanest pairs of 1's I've ever seen.
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,If you're planning to spend that kind of money might as well get your grails.
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,Buy used. Look for a clean pair on GOAT.
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,"You spending hella money on a shoe so think this one through lmao
I don't understand why people like obsidians. Weird ass color
I would get the mochas. They look good with any fit. Just a clean shoe"
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,lots of people are saying these are expensive prices. These are resell new prices. I always assumed i was just too chicken sh to buy - but I see pics of AJ1's all the time so are people not paying these prices? not taking L's? buying used? lol how tf
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,Fun fact! You could get all four pairs for the price on one if you buy reps.
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,Yeah keep saving nephew
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,seems to be the run away consensus - thanks my g!
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,good question. I would never buy a sneaker to never wear. i want them as an heirloom. to own them the rest of my life and wear for the most special of occasions
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,"i bought a used pair of wave runners from GOAT - and although they were in great shape, when it comes to grails, every time i looked at em I always just wished I spent the cash and bought new. So I recently sold em ahead of this august restock. im banking on hitting the raffle or buying resell"
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,i love the obsidians but i love the mochas even more because it really does go with pretty much everything
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,"I voted mochas but if you are the patient type choose any of the other three besides the black toes. OG colorways like Chicago‚Äôs/Breds/Black Toes/Shadows/Royals always re-retro.

My point is get a pair that for sure will not come out again."
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,It is mostly winning raffles or just getting it retail
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,black toe for sure then. most iconic out of these
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,"That‚Äôs fair. I‚Äôm generally a ‚Äúnew‚Äù guy, but I‚Äôve gotten some great deals on GOAT used. Sometimes it makes sense. Good luck!"
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,"oh interesting. so those classics will reretro, but maybe the mochas never will?"
Jordan 8 Retro,mwwtk9,"Yup, that is exactly what I‚Äôm saying. OG colorways always re-retro. Other colorways either don‚Äôt or take a reallly long time 10-20 years"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Follow shoe pages on Instagram. Local stores should have em, footlocker, shoe palace, and any other chain will have release date info for raffles (cause it‚Äôs ALL raffles now) and then from there hope you hit. That‚Äôs it. UNLESS you want to drop money into a bot and do that but that‚Äôs a whole other thing."
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Goat, stockx and eBay is where I get sneakers from. But you won‚Äôt find any cheap jordan 4s. Unless you buy some used 4s that looks somewhat brand new, that will be the only way to get them for a cheaper price. The cheapest retro 4s out right now are the fibas. They cost $280-350 I think I don‚Äôt really remember."
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,You‚Äôll have to get very lucky to find a pair after release for retail. Most of all new releases are getting back door. I‚Äôve been lucky with a few surprise restocks. I suggest looking on Instagram from a reputable source. You never know what you find.
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,white oreo 4s dropping next month good luck
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Probably will get flamed here, but Mercari. Sellers on that site tend to accept the first offer you make if it‚Äôs reasonable enough and if you get something you feel isn‚Äôt legit, Mercari will side with you in returning it."
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,Join SoleSavy.
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"That's pretty much what I'm doing and yeah I don't want to buy from restocks or whatever bullshit overpriced botsales.
I just stumbled upon an online store called [mymonaveli.com](https://mymonaveli.com/products/nike-air-jordan-retro-4-sneakers-5)
Is that store legit?"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"I've been searching for kicks on ebay a lot
But I don't want to buy used shoes for that much money
I don't know it just feels wrong to me
I don't want, nor can I afford, to buy overpriced sneakers from restocks or stockx

I know there aren't  many other options though"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Yah I'm on it
Thanks mate"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,Definitely not
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,That‚Äôs the game man :/ I haven‚Äôt gotten a pair of hyper Jordan‚Äôs in a few months lol but that‚Äôs how it goes bro
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Definitely nothing wrong with rocking used shoes especially if they look new. And if you plan on wearing them anyway then u shouldn‚Äôt care much. But i understand how u feel I am like that with the metallic 4s pack as well. I‚Äôll buy all of them eventually brand new. 

But I bought some jordan 12 dark Grey used but they have no creases just a scuff on the back."
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"i‚Äôm trying to get them too, they‚Äôre so clean"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"It was too good to be real
Fuck me"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Yah you're right about that
Usually if I want anything Id buy it but the sneakergame is so unbelivable time consuming it can be a little frustrating
I guess I'll stick with another pair of airmax 1 then for now
Thanks anyways man! 

I'll take some time and get into it I'm sure I can be faster than the fucking bots /s"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Yore actually the first person to ever tell me this
Maybe I'll give it a try if I find a offer I can live with"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Indeed they're dope af
Good luck man may the force be with you"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Yo got a question
Why can't I find the white oreo in the Nike snkrs app?"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,Good luck man trust me I know the feeling. Stay strong and hopefully get a W soon.
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,You can also try looking on online marketplaces like Facebook and Kijiji. Depending where you live you can get some decent pairs without the extra for shipping and customs
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"because we‚Äôre too far from the release date right now, we should get info closer to launch, i‚Äôm pretty sure nike hasn‚Äôt even confirmed their launch yet. in a couple days i‚Äôm going to check footlockers site and shit for the launch calendar and see if they‚Äôre coming out on may 29. also if you want better luck with the snkrs app make sure to go on there everyday and interact with stories and just look around"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"Okay I'll stay put
I've already done some preparations
Man If I'll get two pairs I'll sell one of them to you for retail price"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,what size are you going for?
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,44 so US 10
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,"ah i‚Äôm a bit too big for that, don‚Äôt worry about me"
Jordan 8 Retro,mubsis,Haha okay thanks anyways
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,"God, these sneaker brands really have a hold of us. We're literally getting upset that they won't allow us to pay $170 for a pair of shoes."
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Missed out on the Mochas so I went and raged copped a 2021 Honda Civic Hatchback.ü•¥
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Literally have been trying to cop on SNKRS since 2017. You know how many shoes I‚Äôve copped? FUCKING ZERO. I‚Äôm so fucking tired of this man
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,I hate shoes I‚Äôm never wearing them again
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Did you guys have to manually select your size on SNKRS? This is like the 3rd this have happened to me...
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Man I wish SNKRS would be faster about giving me my L so I can go back to sleep.
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Anyone else just straight up never got past the waiting rooms for finish line and JD?
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Shoe Palace randomly shows sizes at 11:28 EST -- all sizes sold out. suspect.
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,I woke up at 6 fucking 30 for this shit. Now it‚Äôs 9:00 and have nothing to show for it. Bullshit ass release
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,[removed]
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,bots vs humans this is how the matrix got started y‚Äôall
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,I really need someone to tell me to just pull the trigger on resale. I need this so bad.
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Can‚Äôt believe I could not even touch one pair for retail.
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,"Me waiting for a restock, thinking I'll be able to cop ü§°"
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,May the gods be by your side tomorrow morning everyone.
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,How do people take Ls and then come back in to win 10 and 10.5 when people like me are sitting on 10 from the get go???
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,"Why the fuck do I do this shit. I put my name in every fucking raffle I could find and watched the clock to have this God forsaken app refreshed at the right time. Same result as always, a fat ass L"
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,"pain is all i feel, literally the only pair of shoes i want üòî"
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Had to bite the bullet and pay resell. paid $309 for a size 8 so hopefully I don‚Äôt regret it in a month. Just wanted a personal God WHY?:(
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,DTLR is milking their 48 hours in the spotlight knowing people turned on their Tweet notifications
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Refreshing sites for 90 minutes like a clown.  At least today of all days its acceptable to go full clown
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,so much for that supposed restock
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,"I remember when these was still the ""Poor man's Travis Scotts"" LOL

A lot of people who were down talking these are hurting today"
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Anybody still pending on 10 5?
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,shoe palace is ass for reals
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,If you flip the ‚ÄòEm in Got ‚ÄòEm it becomes ‚ÄúGot Me‚Äù...
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Took an L on the SNKRS raffle. My buddy texted me like 5 hours later and shows me a screenshot where he copped in my size for me. I am so goddamned blessed.
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Good luck to everyone. Hoping for my first SNKRS W of the year.
Jordan 8 Retro,jldj56,Why is it so hard to get a W for one pair? Meanwhile I see some people catching multiple W‚Äôs. Insane
Jordan 8 Retro,miii76,6 DMP
Jordan 8 Retro,miii76,Gold Toe 1s
Jordan 8 Retro,miii76,AJ4 Royalty
Jordan 8 Retro,miii76,I‚Äôve always liked the Ronnie Fieg x ASICS GL III ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù and more recently the Off-White x Air Rubber Dunk ‚ÄúUniversity Gold‚Äù
Jordan 8 Retro,miii76,The golden moments pack
Jordan 8 Retro,miii76,Ric Flair X Dame 7
Jordan 8 Retro,miii76,"That‚Äôs a solid pick, I never though that light blue and gold would go together, but it‚Äôs still clean af"
Jordan 8 Retro,mr0los,Do u have a wide foot?
Jordan 8 Retro,mr0los,Yea but other size 11s jordan 1‚Äôs fit fine
Jordan 8 Retro,mr0los,Maybe try a 12 or really open them up. Take the laces out and relace them loose
Jordan 8 Retro,mr0los,Ah yea i was at a resell store so idk if i woulda been able to do all that
Jordan 8 Retro,mg2edn,If you‚Äôre size 11.5 for Nike air Max‚Äôs going 11.5 should be fine maybe even just 12 to be safe 1s can be a lil snug on wide feet
Jordan 8 Retro,mg2edn,"Hold up, that‚Äôs some of the most drastic difference in sizes I‚Äôve come across between brands. 

In your case, you are definitely going to have to do some more research (trying pairs in store, looking up vids for specific pairs, etc.) Are you wide footed? That matters between Jordan models as well. 

See if you can try on a pair of Jordan 1‚Äôs as that is what most people are familiar with and once you have your sizing from there, it‚Äôs much easier to reference differences in sizing between models. I can add that most people size down from their Jordan 1 size on the Forces though"
Jordan 8 Retro,mg2edn,Thanks! Know anything about the other 3 though?
Jordan 8 Retro,mg2edn,"I actually do have wide feet thus the difference in sizes, but can't try because all my friends have way smaller feet than me üòÖ my local foot locker also sucks they don't have a very large variety of shoes :/"
Jordan 8 Retro,mg2edn,Jordan‚Äôs in general tend to fit the same for me anyways.
Jordan 8 Retro,mg2edn,Alright thanks!
Jordan 8 Retro,mpsw6t,Threes are a little wider in the toebox area compared to 4s
Jordan 8 Retro,mpsw6t,They run similar. You‚Äôre good.
Jordan 8 Retro,mpsw6t,Oh damn so are you saying I should of got a 10.5?
Jordan 8 Retro,lzofji,Amazing! I accidentally became a sneaker head and my wife always ask if I‚Äôm going to wear the shoes more than once üòÇ
Jordan 8 Retro,lzofji,"Nice diversity! It only gets more fun as time goes on haha. Convince yourself (and your wife) that it‚Äôs an investment. Their value is much more stable than the stock market haha. 

Dubai has a nice Concept‚Äôs location in the mall I believe... cncpts.ae"
Jordan 8 Retro,lzofji,"Lmao me too, started off with 77 blazers, with the black stripe, the simple ones."
Jordan 8 Retro,ltzj0k,What size are you? Because the price you are looking at is for pre school sizing
Jordan 8 Retro,ltzj0k,"PS: Pre School
Y: Youth
GS: Grade School
W: Women‚Äôs

Be careful not to buy those if you‚Äôre looking for men‚Äôs sizes

And the Lucky Greens were ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs sizes‚Äù so go up 1.5 sizes. For example, I‚Äôm a size 10 men‚Äôs, so I wear 11.5 in women‚Äôs"
Jordan 8 Retro,ltzj0k,"Yeah PS size, if you are lucky they will fit your hand"
Jordan 8 Retro,ltzj0k,Rip
Jordan 8 Retro,ltzj0k,"If I‚Äôm remembering correctly Youth and Grade School are the same size as Mens. A youth 7, grade school 7, and men‚Äôs 7 are all the same size shoe."
Jordan 8 Retro,ltzj0k,You are correct!
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,GOAT used is legit. I've sold sneakers I've worn literally once for good prices that would pass as Deadstock if you didn't look at the bottom.
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,I say go for it!
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,"Any problems you have with them will be your fault since its your job to look at the pictures and see that they're in the condition you want. Just make sure you look thoroughly. For example, I bought a pair that was $100 under resale and they were barely worn, but they had orange marks I didn't see in the pictures. You shouldn't have to worry about authenticity. Just condition"
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,I‚Äôve gotten used 4s from there and have been consistently happy with the overall condition. The GOAT clean stuff is good too
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,"The bottom of these are super clean too. Like, all the stars are still there."
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,Great!
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,That's my other main issue. The photos look pretty good. I hesitate to send the link because I don't want someone else to buy them.
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,I'm even more thrilled!
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,Just don't take too long trying to figure out what to do. Someone bought the pair I was looking at while I was making sure they were okay once
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,"Yeah, I'm kind of stressing about that."
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,"I'd say the main thing you should look for is cracks in the midsole or midsole paint, and depending on the upper material, dirt or damage. If its leather, then you should be able to wipe any scuffs off. Just make sure they're just scuffs and not damage. If its suede, make sure there's as little dirt as possible because suede is kinda hard to clean. If they seem good, get them"
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,"If you're interested, the photos are available through this link: Check out the Air Jordan 4 Retro OG 'Bred' 2019 on GOAT https://goat.app.link/FblJssDOAcb."
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,The only problems I see with them besides the box is that the paint on the side of the right shoe isn't perfect and the bottom of the throat (where the tongue attaches to the rest of the shoe) is crooked
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,"I don't care too much about factory flaws, only because they aren't something you can technically control."
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,Well they look pretty much perfect to me in terms of how used the look
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,"Doubt you care, but I got them in hand and I am very pleased. The only real issue is some very slight creasing on the toe."
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,"Thanks, man. Good looks."
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,Thats insane for half the price. Congrats on the great pickup!
Jordan 8 Retro,klxjsx,Thanks! Now I need to decide weather I want to keep them or sell them.
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,[deleted]
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Why do I continue to wake up at 7AM on Saturdays for this bullshit.
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"Finish line L, footlocker L, champs L, footaction L, can‚Äôt wait for this upcoming SNKRS L üôå"
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"Fuck this stupid ass toxic sneaker culture. Stupid cunts can‚Äôt even take my money when I want to give it to them. 

I‚Äôll see you fellas next drop."
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"Dear Footsites,

Please just tell us your fucking sizes are all sold out so we can move on with our days.

Best,
Getsituated"
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"Damn what kind of hobby makes it impossible to buy the one thing you like? Can‚Äôt cop anything for retail anymore, like it‚Äôs so impossible to buy retail that retail price is almost none existent. Only chance an average joe-schmo guy gets a pair of shoes he wants is either bs re-sell price, or the guy sacrificed one of his children to the shoe gods for a Jordan 1."
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,I hope somebody spits in the sandwich of whoever designed finishline's and jd sports' waiting rooms
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"Well, SNKRs giving me the dreaded Pending of Death..."
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,[removed]
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Good luck to everyone who actually wants these to wear.
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"SNKRS doesnt want my money, thats cool. Time to check out the dark side."
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"2 HOURS WAITING FOR FINISHLINE AND I GET ACCESS DENIED!

sorry for caps."
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"First W on snkrs, actually gassed been wanting these since they were first announced, skipped on the mids hoping to get them"
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Just walked into a Footlocker and copped. No line or anything
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Brehs I‚Äôve worked a whole ass 12 hr shift with shoe palace and I still haven‚Äôt gotten through lmfao.. feelsbadman
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"Fuck it, getting some Jordan 1 lows. Very underrated shoe. Great for lifting, running, nice casual shoe... easy to cop even the best colorways. Please let these stay unpopular"
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,oh boy this is about to be a shitshow. footsites already glitching
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Footsites can honestly get fucked what in the hell is this Access Denied bullshit
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Usually on SNKRS right on time and catch the L. Forget today and submitted the order at 10:04 and get a W. Makes sense.
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Why is it literally impossible to get a shoe for yourself now
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,SNKRS has gotten gradually worse and worse over the years..
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,At least snkrs and the adidas raffles are passive. You submit and just have to hope. I‚Äôm gonna be watching this ‚Äúyou are in the waiting room‚Äù page for an hour.
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,This might be the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Literally have gotten in line on SNKRS in the first 10 seconds for the last 5 pairs I've wanted and it's all Ls. Shits sad.
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"Honestly, how hard it is to make your website show sizes sold out, when they're sold out.  click, click, click, click...."
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Shocking won on SNKRS this morning for my dads size. I haven‚Äôt won on that app since October 2019 smh
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"My girlfriend who took the reins for me while I showered and accidentally got me banned earlier just got through on her phone. Picked up a size 9 luckily thanks to her üôèüèæ I wasn't having any luck and I've been trying since 12, then she tries for barely 30 minutes and gets through, go figure lol

Good luck to everybody else still trying, keep going. It seems like people are getting through now."
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,"Finish line is still telling me I'm in line to get in on the site lmao

Edit: Day 20 still waiting in line for smoke greys"
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,Im pretty sure it would be easier to cop a gun than a pair of Jordan 1s at this point lol
Jordan 8 Retro,hp6kx0,So what's the move? Try to cop right at 10 on snkrs and then move to foot sites?
Jordan 8 Retro,kdcu4c,These are my favorite shoes of 2020. I also copped a pair
Jordan 8 Retro,kdcu4c,"They‚Äôre bonkers, I needa cop a pair"
Jordan 8 Retro,kdcu4c,Had too double up
Jordan 8 Retro,kdcu4c,"You love to see it, bio hack > mocha change my mind"
Jordan 8 Retro,kdcu4c,Also did pink laces
Jordan 8 Retro,l1641u,Awesome! This is exactly how I was able to get the ‚ÄúGym Red 1‚Äôs‚Äù last summer. Was randomly looking and they restocked size 12.
Jordan 8 Retro,l1641u,Yeah that‚Äôs crazy! Interesting how over a year later they randomly get a size in for them lol
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,"I had Mochas and Midnight Navys at the same time and the difference was nuts. Mochas leather is plasticy, and the tongue and brown ‚Äúsuede‚Äù feel cheap. Pretty much the exact opposite on the Midnight Navys, which have buttery leathery, leather on the tongue, embroidered logo on tongue, nicer blue suede, insole that says CO.JP, and a cool box. The difference in the resale price between the two makes no sense really, it‚Äôs really *just* because the Mochas look like TS1s."
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,I mean look we‚Äôre talking about probably the most produced Jordan of the year. To expect anything above passable is too much for Nike
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,"no ppl in the sub just eh...whenever they say ""omg that nike leather is so good"" lol..."
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,I have a feeling the resale price will flip . The midnight navy are üî•
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,This is by no means the most produced jordan of the year.
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,"How so? I can‚Äôt think of much of a contender besides the fire reds or the flints, but the mochas were way more hyped and Nike still probably made more"
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,Fire reds and jubilees have absolutely massive stock
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,"I think it seems like they might have more stock because they were more readily available. You have to think literally everyone and their mom wanted the Mochas, they were the biggest release of the year in terms of what people wanted to buy the most. And every store you can think of had them. And Nike knew this, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there was close to 300k pairs, if not more"
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,"Yeah, but usually the holiday release 11s have anywhere from 500k-2 million.  I think mocha stock was 250-300k"
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,"Lol I‚Äôm sorry but I highly doubt the Jubilees were anywhere near 500,000 pairs, much less 2 million. I don‚Äôt even think Nike would want to make that many pairs. Not even that many people want that pair"
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,"All holiday 11s have stock numbers around 500k and if it's an og 11, like concords or breds, it'll be above a million"
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,"I don‚Äôt know about all that. I know the most selling shoe Jordan sold was the Oreo 5s, and those were around 500,000 I believe"
Jordan 8 Retro,k9ft20,there were 2 million bred 11s last year
Jordan 8 Retro,kep5to,"eBay, plus it also verifies sneakers"
Jordan 8 Retro,kep5to,"I would recommend grailed, Depop and eBay"
Jordan 8 Retro,kep5to,I just bought some Jordan 1s off eBay last night. Best price I could find and they now authenticate sneakers just like GOAT and stockx.
Jordan 8 Retro,kep5to,You won‚Äôt find them cheaper if they‚Äôre real. Market value is at 400
Jordan 8 Retro,kep5to,r e p s n e a k e r s
Jordan 8 Retro,kep5to,"AF1s and 77s are in stock in nikes website, 100% buy from them if possible."
Jordan 8 Retro,kdhzpt,"Cool guide. Would love to see a guide of the following AJ1‚Äôs: Rookie of the years, turbo greens, court purples"
Jordan 8 Retro,julhec,"Damn, that's a lot of money. Any clue if this also applies to Europe? I've been wanting to buy something off StockX/GOAT, but I'm not going to if I have to pay additional taxes. Most recent update I could find from StockX was April 2019, but maybe it has changed since then?"
Jordan 8 Retro,julhec,For Europe use klekt.
Jordan 8 Retro,julhec,"Not sure about Europe, but I‚Äôd be prepared to get taxed. It‚Äôs not worth it to be honest."
Jordan 8 Retro,julhec,"Honestly, you can get some pretty good deals on there, so in some cases I would say it's worth it even with additional taxes. I found out that on GOAT you have to pay a 25% added VAT. Still not quite sure about StockX, though."
Jordan 8 Retro,julhec,No import duty with StockX just on GOAT
Jordan 8 Retro,jsardk,"antonioli and luisaviaroma both stock small amounts of Jordan stock, not sure about your size. Sklepkoszykarza is good, although check shipping to your country. I‚Äôve also used sneakerbaas, they were excellent but be careful as not a great returns policy."
Jordan 8 Retro,jsardk,End clothing
Jordan 8 Retro,jsardk,">Sklepkoszykarza

cheers, bud!

&#x200B;

Will check them all out."
Jordan 8 Retro,jsardk,"Nie ma problemu, na zdrowie üòÅ"
Jordan 8 Retro,ib97vi,dont buy on stockx right now. avoid it at all costs. they're hella backed up and people are waiting months to get their shoes. order from Goat
Jordan 8 Retro,ib97vi,"i'd get the obsidians and shadows. 

stockx or goat is your best bet."
Jordan 8 Retro,ib97vi,"I like the obsidians a lot, especially for women more than men, so that's how I would go between the three if I were you (plus, like you said, they're cheaper so you could save money for any cool drops that come out later). 

Personally, I would never buy used shoes without pictures because different people have different definitions for conditions (I've seen creased up shoes be described as barely used lol. I don't know about you, but I want those creases to be mine and not someone else's lol). 

I've purchased a few Jordan 1s recently through stocks and they take anywhere from 1 1/2 weeks to 3 weeks to get to me. Kickscrew charges $35 shipping for me so it stops me from buying. If you are a student, stadium goods has a 5% student discount and they already have the shoes so they can send it out to you asap (but their prices are usually more than stockx, probably because they have to account for the 5% they give students lol). 

Just some quick pieces of info. I'm sure other people can give you a more direct answer to your question."
Jordan 8 Retro,ib97vi,"GOAT all the way, I got my co.jo AJ1 in 6 days after ordering normally for release day"
Jordan 8 Retro,ib97vi,If ur money conscious i'd go with goat if ur okay spending more for new shoes go with stock x (altho they needed 20 days to ship my shoes in July but I'm from a small country in Europe so it's probobly not like that elsewhere) other options are bump and klekt they usually have overpriced stuff compared to goat and stockx but it dosent hurt to look I bought my yeezy cloud white for 200 on bump 4 months ago so there's some good deals on there too.
Jordan 8 Retro,ib97vi,StockX or GOAT
Jordan 8 Retro,ib97vi,"I got my obsidians from KLEKT, only took them 6 days to ship. They should be your best choice"
Jordan 8 Retro,ii9poy,Yeah wtf just use some dish soap on a toothbrush
Jordan 8 Retro,ii9poy,Uhhh... that's a very bad idea. Use soap+water and a brush. Acetone/nail polish remover will destroy those things.
Jordan 8 Retro,ii9poy,It can if you scrub too hard. Honestly it‚Äôs what I use and ive never had problems. Just go slow and be careful.
Jordan 8 Retro,ii9poy,I'll try ty
Jordan 8 Retro,ii9poy,What if I don‚Äôt scrub too hard and only on those spots that don‚Äôt go away with water and soap
Jordan 8 Retro,ii9poy,What shoes do you use the on?
Jordan 8 Retro,ii9poy,Use a magic eraser (and be gentle with it) on those areas before acetone. The only places you can use acetone are on non-painted surfaces such as rubber outsoles.
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,What‚Äôs your budget? I‚Äôd also suggest staying away from the non og models as not many like them. I‚Äôd also consider giving him a gift card to help pay for something he really likes so he can decide exactly which he would prefer.
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,True flight is a no-go. If he mentioned those sneakers he does not want true flights lol. Jordan 5s or 11s are good. The Jordan 11 concord breds just came out! They‚Äôre $185 and reselling around $220-$230 I would recommend trying to find them local as opposed to online like stockx/goat because of the BS fees
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,Also why are Flint 13s a no but Jordan 5/11s aren‚Äôt?! Flint 13s are going around $230-$280 depending size and Jordan 5/11s are around that too depending which kind
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,"The true flight won't probably not impress him ;-) 

To 'whats cool' you can name any shoe and there will be many followers. From the listed shoes, I would always choose the Jordan 11 as I like them the most..

I would suggest that if you only focus on Jordan shoes that they NEED to have a number.

Perhaps you can find a Jordan 3 somewhere as those are very versatile and to the liking of many."
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,Air Jordan 14 Gym Red comes out at 10am on snkrs app. $190 retail. I would try to get those! Your fingers gotta be ready though! https://imgur.com/a/l0EQSFs
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,"1-14 in retros will be good, me personally it‚Äôs 1-13. So true flights won‚Äôt do, the flint 13s are a perfect gift, the gym red 14s that drop in a few hours are one too, and the 11 lows that dropped this past Saturday are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù but also nice."
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,"If the Flint 13s are in your price range, go ahead and pull the trigger. He will love them."
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,"I would try for these when they release.

 [https://sneakernews.com/2020/06/26/air-jordan-1-light-smoke-grey/](https://sneakernews.com/2020/06/26/air-jordan-1-light-smoke-grey/)"
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,Flint 13s!
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,Pretty much anything that‚Äôs not an OG model is an automatic no if he‚Äôs into sneakers.
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,Get him a pair of OW Chicago 1s
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,"The flint 13s are in my range, but the top 3 and thunder 14s are not. I probably should've been more clear"
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,Yeah I would recommend she just checks Facebook marketplace and gets flint 13s. Price check with stockx and get em for cheaper than asking price because stockx takes a big fee.
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,"I figured it was a gift for upcoming bday/she needs it ASAP, so I recommended going for the 14s that come out tomorrow. I would recommend those too but chances are she won‚Äôt get em, lol. I know ima get a big fat L as always."
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,I would do flint 13s in that case
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,"I'm going hard for the 1's. I don't own a gray 1, need that diversity."
Jordan 8 Retro,hjrpdv,I‚Äôm legit considering buying the court purple 2.0s rn. My size for $247. Well $268 after stockx fees... worth it?! Debating between court purple 2.0 royal blue and gym red (gym red cheapest around $205)
Jordan 8 Retro,hpc5un,If anything show them the posted photos of the difference in product that was returned. People like this make me sick and hopefully everything turns out well for you wishing you well.
Jordan 8 Retro,hpc5un,"i‚Äôd start making phone calls.. call grailed support/paypal support. worse comes to worse, you have their address."
Jordan 8 Retro,hpc5un,"I am , thank god I took a picture of that corner , completely different numbers. The box he sent even feels like a fake. Thanks man, just an honest seller here tryna make some extra money üòî."
Jordan 8 Retro,hpc5un,Threaten him with a police report and hopefully he gets scared and return your actual shoes
Jordan 8 Retro,hpc5un,Yeah I‚Äôm about to call them in a bit. Such bullshit how he‚Äôs trying to make himself a victim. Pairs he sent are obviously fake.
Jordan 8 Retro,hpc5un,I hope this works out in your favor
Jordan 8 Retro,ib3zm2,Those for sure
Jordan 8 Retro,ib3zm2,i think its a good price for the condition but if you dont want to go through a cleaning process u can get the metallic 4s
Jordan 8 Retro,ib3zm2,I like the black ones more
Jordan 8 Retro,ib3zm2,"U think 145$ is a good price for their condition? I love the motorsport colorway, j worried abt the price and the condition"
Jordan 8 Retro,ib3zm2,"Also, dyk if I could put them in a washing machine to disinfect them?"
Jordan 8 Retro,ib3zm2,I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs an alright price they look in good condition. And idk
Jordan 8 Retro,ib3zm2,As long as you have (adjustable) shoe trees and some wash bags (on Amazon for the cheap) and delicate cycle on the washer you should be good also get you a good shoe dryer it's only $20-$40 on Amazon also
Jordan 8 Retro,i0qt2q,Definitely size up in these. They‚Äôre comfy but that Zoom unit takes up a lot of room. Half a size up from TTS is a good rule of thumb in the Zoom AJ1‚Äôs.
Jordan 8 Retro,i0qt2q,"Size up! I just bought two pairs (by accident, both my goat and stockx offers got accepted) I‚Äôm a size 12.5/13 and I‚Äôm glad I went with the 13. They‚Äôre tighter in the toebox area compared to a normal aj1 high."
Jordan 8 Retro,i0qt2q,Thanks so much!
Jordan 8 Retro,i0qt2q,Thanks so much!!
Jordan 8 Retro,i2a23a,I‚Äôll personally go with alternate grape. Goes well with dark clothing in my opinion
Jordan 8 Retro,i2a23a,Grape
Jordan 8 Retro,i2a23a,Grapes
Jordan 8 Retro,i2a23a,Grapes!
Jordan 8 Retro,i2a23a,"If you want AG 10.5, hit me up."
Jordan 8 Retro,hsq21u,StockX for $2000 lol
Jordan 8 Retro,hsq21u,preorder lol
Jordan 8 Retro,hsq21u,Ima just cry
Jordan 8 Retro,hsq21u,Lol gna be impossible to cop but gotta try!
Jordan 8 Retro,hsq21u,"That‚Äôs facts, maybe I‚Äôll get lucky ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Jordan 8 Retro,hsq21u,üôè hopefully
Jordan 8 Retro,hsq21u,Thanks G!
Jordan 8 Retro,hqng0g,Sigh... people really think shit like this could be legit yet the same shoes going for 2-3x the price on stockx?! If it were legit either people are making fucking BANk by just buying and selling these OR they‚Äôre fake.... hmmmm ü§î
Jordan 8 Retro,hqng0g,"The odds of you finding a Jordan 1 for retail is near impossible and odds are they‚Äôre fake. Normally if it‚Äôs too good to be true, then it‚Äôs too good to be true"
Jordan 8 Retro,hqng0g,That entire site is just a fake paradise. Steer clear.
Jordan 8 Retro,hqng0g,[deleted]
Jordan 8 Retro,hqng0g,Kixify is a mixture of legit and fakes. I would steer clear and still stick with GOAT or StockX. It's way safer
Jordan 8 Retro,ikhlo5,4s
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,"I‚Äôm gonna say fake. Honestly based off the pictures alone, who takes 5 pictures of the insoles, a portion of 1 outsole, and the inside of one shoe? That‚Äôs just insanely sketchy and on that alone I can deduce they‚Äôre fake.

Also, the rear collar peak is strong as fuck and the back of the swooshes look thick leading to the heel."
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,These are fakes.  Biggest indicators are the toebox & the logo.
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,"Thanks for the LC.

Lol he sent me multiple pics of the insole..

Maybe I should ask for more pics?"
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,"Thanks for the LC.Logo as in the Embossed logo?

If you can, it will be great if you can further elaborate on the toebox part...thanks!"
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,"I‚Äôd always ask for pictures of all angles and box tag pics if available but usually it‚Äôs just good seller etiquette to photograph the shoes as candidly as possible. 

Go ahead and ask for more pics but honestly this is sketch enough as is. What‚Äôs the ask price and what app are they listed on?"
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,"The perforations are non-constant.  In addition, the formations are positioned differently.  While positioning can at times range, spacing does not variate as such on a single pair."
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,"It's listed on a local Facebook group in my country(Singapore) called yeezy boost by amme.

Price is at about 600usd for this pair (us10) bnds."
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,"Also the text on the back tag of the tongue seems to go far up. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt bite, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre fake"
Jordan 8 Retro,gw8rmi,"I got the seller to send me more pics of both the shoes now.  


Will you be kind enough to take a look at them again please?  


Thank you!"
Jordan 8 Retro,hma3v1,Dub Zeros? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Jordan 8 Retro,hma3v1,You got it on the nose. Thank you so much!
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,goat or stockx will prolly give u the best bang for your buck with authenticity. you can try consignment shops and things like that but the shoes have a pretty concrete price range so i'd just go with one of those.
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,"stadium goods, grailed, etc.."
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,"Usually with high resale shoes as the Travis Jordan‚Äôs 1s, goat and stock x is the best. Some of the reps going around are very hard to tell. Kind of suck to spend 1000 on some reps, you know. Was looking for a pair of off white Unc‚Äôs and I learned that the good deals, always fake. No one is going to sell them for anything cheaper then 850 I would say."
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,"Yeah, I got ripped off on a pair of off white unc's; I had paid over $1,300 for them just to learn that they were fake. Luckily I was able to get my money back though."
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,Used or dead stock? Shouldn‚Äôt be an issue if you got refunded. Just disappointed
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,"They were used. Yeah, I was disappointed for sure."
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,Got an amazing pair for 905 I hope they aren‚Äôt. Did they issue a cash refund or their goat credits?
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,"There's an app you can use if you really want to be sure. It's called legit check app. I paid $20, but if you're spending that amount of money then I'd want to be sure. They take about 1 or 2 to verify them, and you can even get a certificate if you'd want. I had gotten a cash refund at the end of the day."
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,You think there‚Äôs a chance they pass a fake pair off? Worried now lmfao
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,Where did you get them from? Goat you said?
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,Yeah
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,"Goat is usually pretty good at detecting fakes; They even have an self learning AI that will automatically take down fakes if it detects it and their cases of sending fakes are a lot lower than stockX. But with fakes getting so good these days there's almost no guarantee, they even fool the best people."
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,Thanks man didn‚Äôt know they had an ai for that. Got pics of the pair look good to me but Then again spotting reps I‚Äôm not the best at.
Jordan 8 Retro,g3tgeb,"No, yeah me neither. Like I said I you want to be sure check out that app. It'll ease your mind if you're that unsure"
Jordan 8 Retro,hy6nx8,Got a pair TTS. Wish I went a half size up.
Jordan 8 Retro,hy6nx8,This is very helpful.
Jordan 8 Retro,hkg2b9,"Adidas supercourts and vans for more plain/minimal shoes, New Balance for brighter shoes."
Jordan 8 Retro,hkg2b9,"Nike Blazers are a good choice for a vintage looking, simple sneaker."
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,these are for little kids. GS stands for grade school
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,"A bit iffy on this. 
I‚Äôd ask for pic of inside text for good measure. 

- Wings logo is off
- Corner stitch
- Toe box shape"
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,They look legit to me. I would ask for some pictures of the interior to make sure they don‚Äôt have any   f o o t      f u n g u s
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,It says 100% legit in the description..
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,Yeah.  I wear a size 7 dude.
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,Could it be just wear and tear?
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,Right but anyone can put 100% legit and get away with it...
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,"My b, I guess I always thought there was some conversion from GS Y to mens like mens to women sizes 

good luck"
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,"Toe box, sure.
Also the box is a bit different. 

Don‚Äôt know if my concerns depends on shoe size. Again I‚Äôd try to get pic of inside text to get a better verdict. 

Purchase with caution."
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,"If the OP looked, the seller has a 99% feedback and has 500 + successful transactions ü•¥"
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,It‚Äôs ok.  I know not many on here wear kid size shoes.  I was just trying to find out if these are legit or not.
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,It‚Äôs a 7Y
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,Just an FYI. Men‚Äôs size 7 and 7Y are the same size but men‚Äôs 7 is much better build and material quality. But they never really make fakes of GS shoes as there‚Äôs no market really
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,They‚Äôre fake
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,I kinda figured.  I‚Äôm searching for the Royal 1s and bred 1s.  I‚Äôm still gonna go with the 7Y for now.  I already got my two grails in 7 adults (concords and Seattle 10s).  I never owned a Retro 1 so I‚Äôm gonna stick with what I fit most Jordan‚Äôs with.
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,Sigh why is it so hard to find actual shoes instead of replicas.
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,I had to pay an arm and a leg for adult size 7 breds and royals so keep that in mind when you want to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù from GS
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,Oh I know lol.  It‚Äôs running for 500-600 on stockx right now.  Which is no surprise since they‚Äôre some of the more popular colorways.
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,Yeah having small feet sucks so I know your pain. I guess it‚Äôs better than having size 15 feet or something
Jordan 8 Retro,ffkt9z,Well when it comes to reselling yeah.  I envy the big shoe sizes.  The chances of them not getting what they want is small.  I mean how many people on the planet have size 15 feet?
Jordan 8 Retro,gzbjsg,6.5
Jordan 8 Retro,gzbjsg,"for sure 6.5 , air forces tend to fit big"
Jordan 8 Retro,gzbjsg,Thank you!!
Jordan 8 Retro,fpiv7a,Idk about the sizes but if you looking for copping for retail i use @solelinks on Twitter sometimes there comes jordan 1‚Äôs but have to fast
Jordan 8 Retro,fpiv7a,"Jordan 1‚Äôs run pretty TTS, maybe even a bit small, especially if you want to wear crease protectors. I‚Äôd go size 13. 

Color wise, there aren‚Äôt many Jordans with the white logo, some off of the top of my head are the unc‚Äôs and the neutral greys. I‚Äôd stick with the gym reds, unless you like the suede on the neutral greys.

Also, the gym reds are close to retail (under in size 13 on goat), so i‚Äôd go with them."
Jordan 8 Retro,fpiv7a,"I find most Jordan‚Äôs true to size, with the exception of 11‚Äôs. 1‚Äôs are almost always tts. You‚Äôll want to be aware of   mids vs highs in 1‚Äôs as mids can catch your eye and look almost like highs, but are sadly often inferior in material quality. I‚Äôd watch the sneakers app and Nike.com right now too, Nike is going to be trying to move inventory fast."
Jordan 8 Retro,fpiv7a,"Air Jordan 1 yin yangs are really simple, really dope material, and usually really cheap"
Jordan 8 Retro,fpiv7a,Thanks. I will keep an eye on their Twitter.
Jordan 8 Retro,fpiv7a,"Thank you for the sizing advice. I just might have to jump on the gym reds on goat. I don‚Äôt 100% need the white logo, more so any of the classic black/red/white with a preferred red or black upper. Not really a fan of the bloodline-like ones that Nike currently has for sale though. Again thank you for the advice!"
Jordan 8 Retro,fpiv7a,No problem glad to help
Jordan 8 Retro,fpiv7a,"Gym Red is the way to go for you. A lot of the red/white/black J1‚Äôs are og 1985 colorways, therefore a lot more expensive than your gym reds. Enjoy!"
Jordan 8 Retro,fxarfo,They‚Äôre all made with the logo. However some pairs are painted so the logo matches the leather and is not visible.
Jordan 8 Retro,fxarfo,Dunks look similar without that branding.
Jordan 8 Retro,fxarfo,Jordan 1 rare air
Jordan 8 Retro,fxarfo,You could try knock offs lol
Jordan 8 Retro,fxarfo,"Ahh thats unfortunate information, thanks though, appreciate it."
Jordan 8 Retro,fxarfo,"Ill look into them, thanks."
Jordan 8 Retro,fxarfo,"No problem. As someone else said, dunks are close and you may find a colour way in those you‚Äôd like"
Jordan 8 Retro,fxarfo,"Look into the Jordan 1 Bloodline. Excellent leather quality, subtle wings logo, and easily one of the best colorways of 2019. It‚Äôs very cheap too."
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,i had a fucking reservation for a pair on Nike+ but didn't check my app yesterday and now it expired fuckmylife
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,Fuck this garb I just YOLO'd and bought a pair on StockX for 265 wit free shipping.  I ain't got time to bleed.
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"""Wow such an easy cop!!""

pls stop"
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,My firm asked me to come in on Saturday to meet with a potential client. I asked to be excused for a few minutes for this drop and got the W on SNKRS. not fuckin worth losing my job if anyone found out but I'm happy right now üò≠üôèüèΩ
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,[deleted]
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,Lol fuck you if you bought two pairs
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,Real talk. Is it worth going to Niketown Chicago on Michigan at like 4am to wait for these? Or is the line already going to be insane the night before? I've never actually tried to physically get a pair by going to a store super early. If you've done this before at the Chicago store let me know how it went.
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"So I went to Champs on Monday to get a raffle ticket and was told by an employee they weren't doing a raffle, it is first come first serve. So I've been here since 5 AM wondering why people aren't showing up. The manager gets here and opens the store and sees me sitting here and tells me they did A FUCKING RAFFLE. I can't get my size now...only size 12. Store opens in an hour, what do I do?"
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"FUCK THIS SHIT MAN, FUCK IT, I HATE BOTS, I HATE NIKE, I'M GONNA FUCKING RUN INTO THE OCEAN AND DIE."
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"- Camped out for 4 hours only to have the guy in front of me take the last pair
- Struck out on SNKRS, eastbay, finishline
- Waited in line for unclaimed pairs..store runs out 
- Nearest eight stores also sold out
- Kept cold calling twice a day, every day since
- Struck gold today after a foot locker not too far away had one LAST pair which happened to be in my size

NEVER give up! Elated right now. This is why I'm in the game. "
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"snrks didn't used my saved credit card, so i had to type it in. when i hit submit for my info, it told me i needed to add a form of payment. bitch i just did. "
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,already know i didnt get the shoes
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,[deleted]
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,It'll be a GR they said...it'll be an easy cop they said. 
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"Managed to hit on SNKRS, and was third in line, so I just left to give everyone a chance at copping. Just waiting on that confirmation email...."
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"You guys seeing all these pairs already available for purchase on eBay? How those guys do that? Is it Fufu? Are they like Bumpy Johnson, raiding delivery trucks?"
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,Fucking ordered a pair and got sent Yin-Yang pack AJ1ms instead. My luck.
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"No raffles won, debating if I should go camp out at one of the FCFS spots near me. If anyone is in the Twin Cities area and wants a camping buddy let me know"

Edit: Just got shipping conf! Thank god for Niketalk."
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"wtf my snkrs page never refreshed

shit was slow as a snail

anyone else have that?"
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,Does SNKRS auto refresh at the drop time or do we have to close amd reopen the app?
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"Never done this before but I'm at the mall at 6AM, no one is here, I'm first in line lol. 4 hours to go till store opens. "
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,Couldnt cop from snkrs. Found someone on Grailed thouh for 215 so I took that. Semi L?
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,Meanwhile Adidas bois trying to cop their Wangs

Gee, thanks. Why not just let people claim them and give them 5 minutes to buy them like literally any other hot item. Fuck. "
Jordan 8 Retro,62lzbz,"this is the first pair of Jordans I'll be trying to buy, hopefully I get a W"
Air Max 95 SE,mf672c,Worldwide pack aye?) how they feel on feet m8
Air Max 95 SE,mf672c,Yeah they are. Really good fit considering I got a half size smaller than usual as that was the only stock available and I really wanted them!
Air Max 95 SE,cc2vb5,"Every pair of this colorway does, yes."
Air Max 95 SE,cc2vb5,"buy them now....these are so dope, top 5 in my rotation right now"

Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,"slept on these and so should have gotten them

one of my favorite AM's"
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,These are growing on me. 
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,How's sizing on these? I have widish feet so I usually have to go half size up.
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,"How's the comfort on them compared to normal AM95?

I'm hesitating between the cool grey AM95 essential and the black ultra SE for my beaters."
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,Dad shoes
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,Thanks!
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,They have most sizes at endclothing - and they're under retail.
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,They do seem a little snug compared to the normal 95s - so you'd probably be OK going up 1/2 size
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,Always one m'fucker...
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,"I will look there, thank you!!"
Air Max 95 SE,4x2gek,"Nice, thanks for the input! 95s have been on my radar for a while and I'm really digging the flywire on these."

Air Max 95 SE,iyv5q6,95s probably one of the comfiest trainers you can get not had a pair of 97's so cannot vouch for them but between vapourmax and 95s I'd go for the 95's
Air Max 95 SE,iyv5q6,They feel very similar under the foot; maybe 97s are a little nicer because of the different shape of the air bag. It really comes down to if you prefer a low top (97) or a mid top (95)
Air Max 95 SE,iyv5q6,"97s have always been extremely uncomfortable for me, and I have pretty narrow feet too. Pretty stiff and unforgiving, never tried vapor max so idk how they compare though"

Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,Those Woei's and B&Y's are a steal!
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,The Link for the Concords is wrong.  It links to a video.
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,"Definitely a couple pairs I'm gonna bid on. As always, thanks for posting dude!"
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,Those 8 lows are dope if I felt like dropping $80 on shoes right now.
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,Can you send me pics of the peapods?
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,"I would LOVE to cop those Penny 1s. But I'm wondering, why'd you put unwearable? Are they unwearable to you? Just keep those Penny's and I will buy them for sure, unless they are actually ""unwearble."" lol."
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,"Glad to have confirmation on that, I wasn't sure what the going price for Woei's was but I was pretty sure it was higher than the BIN."
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,"Yes it does, I'll get rid of it."
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,"Definitely not something you see everyday. The dope thing about those is you can rock them with jeans and they look almost identical to the highs, but they look even better with shorts. "
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,"I'll take some pictures tomorrow and PM you the album. There's absolutely no flaws though, they've been worn 2 times."
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,"In their current condition they are literally unwearable, the air bag has popped on one shoe and the sole has separated from the airbag on both. The separation is an easy fix with some shoe glue, but I'm not sure how to fix an airbag. That's why I'm selling a pair of shoes from 1995 for $60."
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,"Yeah - Usually for Woei's I'd expect around a $500 mark BIN ([This](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Asics-Gel-Lyte-III-3-WOEI-BEIGE-BROWN-TAN-WHITE-METALLIC-GOLD-NEW-DS-Sz-9-5-/300774807297?pt=US_Men_s_Shoes&hash=item4607935701) is the only other pair I can find), but the pair you linked could go for an even better price on bidding."
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,Alright sounds good
Air Max 95 SE,1b9o6c,Oh. Then I'll pass. Well thanks for being honest anyways! :)
Reebok Question Mid,lvwgkb,They need to get AI on hot ones to put this sneaker over the top lol

Reebok Question Mid,lvwgkb,"If these didn't have all the chicken branding, they'd be a really fly CNY pair."
Reebok Question Mid,lvwgkb,I've been thinking about getting a pair of the shaqnosis off of eBay. They didn't come out in Canada and these didn't have a release date for Canada. But I looked today and they come our March 15 in Canada üá®üá¶ but I ordered this from the states just to make sure I got them

Reebok Question Mid,jlnw27,I copped the red suede toe a couple months ago and i went with my regular hooping size 12 (lifestyle i go with 11.5)  and it fits good but i will say the toe box is mad narrow for me. But i do have wide feet. But after wearing them for a few houta my pinky toes are definitely feelin it lol
Reebok Question Mid,jlnw27,Fits narrow for me especially toe area. Had to go up half a size.
Reebok Question Mid,ij0dhh,Those pair well with your socks. I appreciate the shoe.

Reebok Question Mid,ia1r5v,What about it lol. Nice shoe.
Reebok Question Mid,fy75lj,"Does anyone know if these fit true to size? I have wide feet, so would you recommend going half a size up or not? As a point of comparison, I'm size 9.5 for AF1 mids, but for Adidas Grand Courts and Continental 80s I wear size 10."

Reebok Question Mid,140nyx,"The Question Mid was one of my favorite sneakers when it released back in the 90's, as were most of Iverson's sneakers. The retro's were a must-have for me."
Reebok Question Mid,140nyx,"this release got me to love the questions. when I was a kid these were the ugliest shoes. THE most ugliest. I liked the more modern looking bball kicks. but now that I'm older I love old school leather kicks and questions are awesome. I have the red suede goes and the burn rubbers. 

btw really awesome pic. how do u take such beautiful pics?"
Reebok Question Mid,140nyx,Those are sweet. I wanna pick a pair up. Where did you get them from?
Reebok Question Mid,140nyx,"Years of practice haha. A good camera helps, too. I happen to use a Nikon D70 at the moment, but I'm hoping to upgrade soon."

Reebok Question Mid,12j4cq,"Thanks! Yeah, I gotta keep a few non-Nike/Jordan's around to switch it up."
Reebok Question Mid,11489w,if these are the leather toe its an amazing price.  The leather toes that released a few months ago are selling for 220-250 on ebay.
Reebok Question Mid,11489w,"Hopefully. The poster of the ad said they were ""Vintage Reebok Allen Iverson Shoes"" so I have my hopes up that they're an old retro or maybe even the OG's. "

Reebok Question Mid,2lor9s,"Not to shit on anyone who reads this but I believe it's because everyone here is so young, they weren't wearing these when they were like 9 years old. Iverson made Reebok cool again after it had died down after Dee Brown, Big Dog, Kemp, and Shaq. Since AI there hasn't been any big name wearing Reeboks so they've fallen off (Isaiah doesn't count). EVERYONE was wearing reeboks in the 90's. "
Reebok Question Mid,2lor9s,"Answer iv-vi. Remember when everyone in the hood had them, but I couldn't buy the ivs because I just copped some And 1s off discount. smh"

Reebok Question Mid,2lor9s,"Agreed.The Question Mids, in the right colorways, are just as hot--if not hotter--than most J's, in my opinion, "
Reebok Question Mid,2lor9s,its possible but i was in my early teens in the mid 90's. But AI did keep reebok relevant for over a decade

Reebok Question Mid,eui737,Your friend's a hypebeast. Reebok's are dope af
Reebok Question Mid,eui737,Classic Reebok still look dope
Reebok Question Mid,eui737,"You will be surprised (pleasantly) to find how dope Reebok as a brand was and still is. Pre-Adidas days, Reebok had Nike beaten for a straight quarter. Look it up.

LX 8500, Ventilator and Ventilator Supreme, Pumps, Phase I and II, NPC UK 1 & 2, Club C, Instapump Fury, Classic Leather, Bolton, Workout Plus, etc. are some of the models with the dopest collabs.

Long story short, this is that one friend you choose not to listen to. There is an upcoming Tom and Jerry collab dropping on Feb 15."
Reebok Question Mid,eui737,"Reebok is definitely not shit, they have super cool classic leather sneakers. Thing is, many people are really into this running style of sneakers like Ultraboost, and that's a market section Reebok simply doesn't serve. Also their marketing simply isn't on the same level as Nike or Adidas"

Reebok Question Mid,eui737,"If you think you might ever get sick of your shoes or have to sell them for whatever reason, reeboks may not be the way to go. There is a resale market for certain models, but in general there just are a lot less people looking for reeboks and are thus harder to sell...

If you plan on keeping them forever, buy what you like and don‚Äôt worry about what the hype nerds are after. I‚Äôve always loved the pump fury, the dee brown basketball pumps, the michael chang tennis pumps, and many of the iversons."

Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,This is really great. Thanks for doing this. I can tell you put some work in. It's appreciated. 
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,"Damn bro, that was a harsh review of the wings.  Maybe they're also popular because of the aggressive streetwear style that's usually missing from Adidas and Jeremy Scott shoes.  And it wasn't a ""quality"" release?  What defines that for you?  The materials are certainly on point.  No midsole to crumble, and the canvas and rubber will probably last decades.  As someone who works for Adidas, plenty of the ZX, Torsion Allegra, etc retros were nice, but not mind blowing.  I'd trade 5 pairs of ZX700s for those wings.

Especially after ""Nike logo, nuff said"" won it for '88 3s.

Is hype and labeling that important to you?  Am I the only person here who evaluates shoes based on how they *look?*  And going off looks I can't see how the Bape runners would be a better choice; if those didn't have an ape on one shoe and 5 strikes on the other they would still be sitting in outlets.  Ugly shoes."

Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,makes me wish I hadn't sold my C-Notes on here for retail :( 
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,That amazing feeling when you have one of those sneakers in that list... And you got it for retail. Yay
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,"Agreed wings are overrated. I'll take the hanon cntr any day. 

But tassie devils best of the year for nb? Have you held a pair? Yes the colorway is amazing. The teeth detail is crazy. But the quality is subpar at best. At least on my pair. Shape is garbage and, in a year with such quality as the mints and cnotes, materials do not compare. Had it been on the made in America 998 I would wholeheartedly agree with you. Or, had the materials been as quality as ronnies collabs, who managed to put great materials on a China model. 

But again that's your opinion, and I respect it. It's a great shoe, don't get me wrong, but in what I believe to be one of new balances best years, it just can't take 1 for me. 

Now how the hell did the volcanoes not breach the asics list but is the runner up for shoe of the year? 


But hey, happy to finally see the glv again. 

And no category for vans? Obviously it would be supreme vans vs the ubiq pack but still, would have loved to see r/sneakers opinion on those. 

Thanks for doing this tree. R/sneakers has such an interesting opinion, I feel like we need more of these lists. "
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,"Personally I think C-Notes are atrociously disgusting, the silhouette makes is hideous compared to other NBs and the color looks like barf, but everyone's opinion is their own."
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,I'm sorry but the C-notes are the ugliest shoe i've seen yet since i've been in the game. Ridiculous.
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,"I liked the wings as well (certainly more than the bapes at #2). But I also prefered the[ bape campus classic](http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/125551428/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/jpeg-2-2.jpg) and [this mastermind](http://packershoes.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/adidas-mastermind-jp-collection-20.jpg) over either. 

Also the way 'best overall' came about - a lot more shoes should have been in that category but it relied on people nominating them. Not hating on the c-notes but the whole category got different nominations for some reason.

Great work overall though, we need more content like this."
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,"Thank you x10000 for posting this. First time I've heard of them was when I saw they had the most up votes for best Adidas release. Definitely the most eye catching shoe of the list for me, and I came THIS close to buying a pair off eBay until I saw what OP wrote about them. Made me hesitate and think they used really crappy materials.

Are they made well? If so, I'm buying them today."
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,I agree that it is a great shoe...but lets face the truth. If it didn't have Rocky's name on it it would sell like any other wing 2.0. 
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,"> And it wasn't a ""quality"" release? What defines that for you? The materials are certainly on point. No midsole to crumble, and the canvas and rubber

Materials and build are what usually defines a quality release for me, both of which I honestly feel JS's shoes are missing. This is no different than any other, canvas and rubber aren't exactly premium materials; and I've had enough Scott's in my hand to know the construction on his collabs can most of the time be shoddy at best. For example: If you can find me a plush head release that isn't glue stain central all over it's fur, I'd love to see it. 

The shoe is just ... Amazingly plain, to me anyway.

> plenty of the ZX, Torsion Allegra, etc retros were nice, but not mind blowing.

I find all of the following collabs this year to be more *""Mind blowing""* than the Wings:

That was a piss take.

> Is hype and labeling that important to you?
>> if those didn't have an ape on one shoe and 5 strikes on the other they would still be sitting in outlets.

Not in the slightest, and this is actually a testament to that if anything. Going off of mainstream appeal a ""brand"" like A$AP Rocky is going to hold a lot more weight than BAPE or UNDFTD could ever hope to. If anything *(And after some investigation, I don't doubt it)* the Wings were an even more hyped release than the ZX5000 was.

And what of it? If the Camo ZX5000's weren't a collab but kept the exact same premium materials and colourway, I'd buy it in a heartbeat - Probably with a lot more ease too with the absence of branding.

Personally if I were to pick the best Adidas release of the year, I'd choose the Sneaker Freaker Integrals or the Mita Allegras.

*This is all just my opinion, sorry if this comment or the initial review in the OP came off as harsh.*"
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,I was expecting this. 
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,Why would you they do that lol
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,Damn those masterminds look fantastic.
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,"Those campuses look great.  Way better than the runners.

Edit: I am also confused about best overall. I would have given it to the Lebron champ pack.  I guess not enough people scrolled down far enough to vote in that category."
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,All Jeremy Scott shoes are made well.  I've bought about 10 pairs.
Reebok Question Mid,1ugdxw,Then I'd have a pair!  I wasn't ready to drop $250 on release day and that was that. 
Reebok Question Mid,1zby3j,"For anyone not wanting to read all that, go to hypebeast. If a shoe has a bunch of comments of people talking about ""copping"" you will probably be able to resell them. If rappers wear them pre-drop? You can probably resell them. The sneaker resell market is insanely easy to maneuver in."
Reebok Question Mid,1zby3j,"Another thing to consider is you really have nothing to lose if you order from NDC. Free return shipping means if you don't sell em, no harm. "
Reebok Question Mid,1zby3j,Great guide! Enjoied reading it. 
Reebok Question Mid,1zby3j,good guide. 
Reebok Question Mid,1zby3j,">1) the in person approach. CALL YOUR LOCAL STORES DAMN IT I can't tell you how many times during December I'll see posts here asking where one can get them, how do you go about getting them, ect. Call your local Footlocker, Champs, Footaction, Finishline, HOH and just ask ""Are you getting XXX and how are you selling them."" 

Oh yeah.  Calling shops is a great way to get a handle on how limited/in demand a shoe is.  You can gauge resale/difficulty by figuring out how many stores are getting them (10/10, 5/10, 3/10), how many pairs they're getting (10, 20, 50), and asking how much other interest there's been in the shoe.

>2) Now if you are on the fence about buying a shoe, if you know the shoe will sell out and the resale will be at least $50 more than what you paid, why not? Worst comes to worse and you really don't like them you can always return them or sell them to someone who wasn't lucky enough to cop for retail +shipping.

This is where I currently find myself.  Better to have it, not want it, and pass it on than miss out and regret it.

"
Reebok Question Mid,1zby3j,Real talk
Reebok Question Mid,1zby3j,"The supreme thing isn't really true, supreme gets tagged onto all kinds of shoes and doesn't really make a difference. It's just a distinction from nike basketball showing that it has something extra. "

Reebok Question Mid,10sn63,Those and the Motorsport XX3's are the two best deals I found in my opinion. If the Kobe's were bigger I would've doubled up.
Reebok Question Mid,10sn63,"I'll keep an eye out, I'm not as much of an expert on most of them. I know a good amount of them but some of the older more obscure one's I'm not familiar with. "

Reebok Question Mid,10sn63,Not hating for the look out really appreciate it... I just wish more people would put beaters and such on there. Keep these posts coming though if you can and don't mind.
Reebok Question Mid,10sn63,If your not an sb guy jordans are fine as well :P need infared/varsity 6s 9-10.5 preffered or aquas. If you could find that or me i would be forver greatful 
Reebok Question Mid,10sn63,i only look at auction listings because that way you can end up getting a steal.  Usually the BINS aren't super steals.

Vans Ultrarange"
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,Holy crap you have no idea how awesome this is. I'm just getting into the sneaker game and I've been assembling my own list but this is way better.
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,If you make this in alphabetical order I‚Äôll be your best friend 
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,[deleted]
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,you should specify that the NB 574S are the comfortable ones (Especially the ones with the knit uppers)
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,Why do I find vapormax not all that comfortable ... I love the looks of them but wearing them for a day just hurts my sole because the bubbles push into my feet :(
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,Can anybody help me out in choosing one from either adidas NMD Primeknit or Nike Zoom Pegasus 35. The NMDs are on sale in the adidas website down to $119-121 and the Pegasus is $120 so price isn't something to compare. So the NMD Primeknit has Boost midsole and Primeknit upper while the Pegasus has full length Air Zoom unit and Cushlon for the midsole setup . Anyone can share their thoughts ? Thanks üòÅ
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,"New Balance 247 got destroyed in less than a year. The   stretchy top material got covered in cracks, and perforated leather tore down near the big toe. I'm an IT guy, so no significant sttress was done to them. A bit dissapointed. Those made of fabric could be more durable though."
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,Can anyone tell me if the NMD R2 is comfier than the R1?
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,Iniki and chucks are on there. I'll add the others.
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,"I second the Chuck 2's. I've never own Chuck's in their prior iteration because of the lack of cushion. I bought a pair of Chuck 2 low's, and the lunarlon is so incredibly comfortable. I walked around the city for a few hours and didn't feel any soreness. "
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,I posted it because it's what I really wanted when I got back into the game last year. So am I missing anything that you had on your list?
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,Done
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,I considered doing that before cus its honestly my most comfortable shoe. I'll add it.
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,"A lot of subjectivity in terms of what people think is comfortable. Also, some shoes are comfortable short term but not long term like wearing for a whole day. Context is also important. Some shoes are crazy comfy for just chilling or light walking but wouldn't be for heavy amounts of activity-lots of walking, running or sports."
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,"you might need a shoe that has more structure/foot support. I have a pair of '16 Flyknit Air Maxes and find my feet are sore, and both models have similar structures. "
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,If you're using them for running get the pegasus. If more for casual use I'd lean NMD. Also maybe check out the new Nike odyssey react. Same price range I believe. You should try the shoes on before buying.
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,You should go try them on. They're widely available in most shoe stores. 
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,Nope I truly only had the starred ones on your list. How many have you picked up so far? I'm starting big with ultra boost üòä
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,I fucking love you 
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,I own about 15 on this list. Will probably get another 4-5 this year. Ultraboost is always a good first choice.
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,"Do you have an opinion on like, Top 3 most comfortable from this list? Also, most durable?"
React Phantom Run Flyknit 2,7ys0jv,Depends on price range. I love the Nike epic react but durability isn't great. If you like the feeling of boost probably like a darker colorway of Ultra boost or even more durable would be the Ultra Boost ATR. The Kith Nonnative ultra boost mid is fantastic but not cheap depending on your size. EQT Support 93/17 is also really comfy. My bait EQT is probably my comfiest shoe but pricey. Some people find boost to lack firmness that they need for long days where they walk a lot so take that into consideration if you've never tried it. Can't really go wrong with the better Asics and Saucony shoes. I've also heard really good things about Nike Vapor Street Flyknit but the shoe's appearance is polarizing. Hope this helps. DM me if you have any other questions.
Cosmic Unity,n3dfrx,Mine come in on Friday. Surprised how much more i like this color way
Cosmic Unity,mk0jyp,How‚Äôs those cosmic unity fit? I‚Äôm looking to buy a pair
Cosmic Unity,mk0jyp,"I just did legs in the gym with them on. Very performance minded fit. Secure around the medial. Super, super padded collar with and firm but comfortable ankle support. I got my TTS 11.5 and they‚Äôre very responsive on foot."
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,When you got a pick up game on Mars at 4. Lol can‚Äôt wait for my pair to come in.
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,How they feel on foot? I can‚Äôt wait to hoop on those
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,Very cushiony I was planning to hoop in them but I'm a little afraid it'll be too soft
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,Oh dang.  Good heads up.  Still gonna keep em.  Just not use them the same. Still fire though üî•
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,How true to size are these with other Nike's like Jordan 1s? About the same or would you up/down a half size?
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,Yeah I'm going to try them once indoor courts are open again in LA area
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,Hmmm OK so I have interesting feet so take this with a grain of salt. I got long flat narrow feet. I wear AJ1 in Sz 14 and they fit nice. I also wear Air force 1 in Sz 13 and they fit with my toes right at the edge but they break it due to the leather. For basketball I prefer a snug fit and I try to wear 13.5s when available. For the cosmic unity I have a Sz 14 and they fit slightly loosely to where I would need to wear thick socks but not double socks.
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,Indoor is what I was thinking too but ours are still closed too In Houston
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,Yeah see I'm kinda the opposite. Like 11 length but usually have to upsize cause my feet are wide. Thanks for the reply bro.
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,Oooh dman hope yall staying safe with the weather
Cosmic Unity,lwbwri,Thanks bro. Things are better now
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,I was able to grab a pair
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,"They should be in stock right now on Dick‚Äôs sporting goods, just purchased a pair hassle free like an hour - 2 hours ago"
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,"And just like that it‚Äôs sold out, wow. I couldn‚Äôt even buy"
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,"It's sad how every sneaker on SNKRS app is over hyped. People that don't want it are buying just to resell for an arm and a leg. Hopefully they don't resell for much, you might get lucky and find them under retail"
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,Im sad
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,Wow thank you i just ordered
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,I saw dicks sporting good had them but it was sold out by the time i saw
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,Hopefully they restock
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,My condolences my fellow sneaker admirer. Hopefully they add the other color ways
Cosmic Unity,lszq18,But the other color ways don‚Äôt look as good as this one imo smh
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,"The midsole is a little too similar to the Questions for my liking. BUT. We keep asking NIKE for new silhouettes, not just retros. So not a bad offering at all. Overall I do like it a lot and will be buying a pair or two."
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,They look nice I just want to see hoe the perform
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,I was into them until I saw them on feet.
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,Looks like a solid ball shoe
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,"I love them, especially the space hippie cw"
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,I wanna see these in a really crazy colorway with a ton of color. I feel like the crazier the better with these.
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,I like them. Going to pick up the black and green pair and the space hippies. I plan to ball in them and they also look pretty good as some beaters
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,"The one AD is wearing is only PE for BHM. But the black ones come out on the 25th I believe, here https://youtu.be/syMNPEiW7vo . And its only $150"
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,Link?
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,Would you wear it casually?
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,They remind me of questions in a way
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,I was referencing your last two pics. Your post is the first pics I‚Äôve seen on foot. I think it looks amazing on its own though.
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,Personally not cuz it don‚Äôt fit with my style but If u wanna rock em or u think u gotta fit for em they definitely can look fire
Cosmic Unity,lczjaa,Yes the midsole does
Cosmic Unity,lzhytg,"I like the silhouette, they look comfortable...but if you mean ""worth copping""...you mean resale?   No."
Saucony Grid 8000,cvzo8g,I have another pair that is the same but with blue/yellow in place of the pink/purple. I bought both pairs new at a local sale.
Saucony Grid 8000,cvzo8g,[deleted]
Saucony Grid 8000,cvzo8g,Check the code you find on the size tag. It should get you an exact result through google.
Saucony Grid 8000,cvzo8g,Definitely grid 8000. I just can‚Äôt find a photo of any in this color anywhere.
Saucony Grid 8000,cvzo8g,They are samples so the only code I see is RR-SS

Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,Damn how much??????
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,I'll always up vote Saucony's. Their shoes are super comfortable. 
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,I would've bought those in a second.
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,"Damn, lot of sizes?"
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,Holy shit what a find. Where are you from?
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,"I have these too. Seriously underrated shoe! Especially now that summer is coming, perfect shoe.   Quality on them is so much better than anything Nike or Adidas put out. Could you imagine the hype for these if they were a Ronnie Fieg collaboration or something? "
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,Super nice 
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,This are so gorgeous omg 
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,are these good for wide feet?
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,So nice 
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,"Great, great find for marshalls here. Good work!"
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,"poor mans 997 rose, i dig"
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,I'm at the Marshalls now and I don't even see the Ones OP got. Someone must of bought the other two pairs but they have other colors...none of them worth 40 bucks in my opinions though. üòî
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,"Damn these are dope, saconys? Wtf! Stepping their game up.

"
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,looks wack asf. like some shrimp or some shit

Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,"Oh shit I'm from Lynn, MA what Marshalls and do you remember what sizes they had?"
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,Just north of Boston
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,Yeah i have wide feet and i actually went a half size down than what i normally do
Saucony Grid 8000,66y7l5,I had no idea how popular this post would get nor how many Boston sneakerheads were active on this sub. Totally possible others went in and scooped em up

Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Best sauconys I've seen ever. The sauce splashes on the midsole complete the shoe
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,So jealous. Should have picked these up last year. 
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,How do they fit? TTS?
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Siiiick üî•
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Time to get mine out from the box!
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Right?? Crazy
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Said the exact same thing 
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Yep!
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,üò¨
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Lol that time of year Fer sher 
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Oh man didn't realise it was DoctorSoles11! Love your videos man
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,You pick yours up from anywhere in particular or just wherever you see a pair you like?
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,I tried to sell mine around Christmas time. So glad I didn‚Äôt now! Such a great shoe 
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Lol thanks 
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Yea I seek out specific models/colorways and then just shop around for which site has the cheapest price 
Saucony Grid 8000,8ht6dg,Haha yea underrated. Esp for a GR
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,Really wish that splatter wasnt there
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,I fuck with em too
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,Does anyone know the price range for these!
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,Grid 8K is the best Saucony line. 
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"Fuego, I'm grabbing them when they drop"
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,Do these fit TTS? Probably gonna try for these 
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,I was never into Saucony but those are fire
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,These.are.so.clean. 
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,How is sizing on Grid 8000s? I wear a 10.5 in Asic GLV's and they're snug.
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,I like the model. First time seeing saucony without a really long tongue
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"Word, although it would be pretty easy to paint over"
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"Found a Euro site selling them (when they drop) for $157

Asphaltgold and other Saucony stockists are supposed to get them, whenever they drop. "
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,I prefer the 9K and not just because it's 1K more.
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"Will have to scoop some

Edit:whats the best 8k color way"
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,Yeah they fit TTS
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"Easily my favorite brand, even the cheapest pairs that I've picked up are put together so well
"
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"TTS, maybe half up if your feet are very wide. 

If you have to size up half for GL3 or GL5 from your true size, then these are TTS. "
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,I've never seen sauconys with super long tongues. Maybe it's just the way people wear them in the pics you've seen?
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,Thanks
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"Do you know anywhere I should be able to order a pair in the US? I've never bought Saucony, so I don't know where they can be found.
"
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"This one, ""Only In Tokyo"", certain CL colorways, shrimp scampi. Really look into getting a pair of OITs if you can. Great shoe. "
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,Yep my saucony shadow 6000's have a pretty normal tongue too. 
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"I'm not sure who all will carry them. They'll probably be on the official site, maybe END and Kith as well, you know, the usuals. "
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,Ever scoop a pair? 
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"Doooope, the Only in Sohos are what got to me into Saucony. The Footpatrol  collabs are goat in my opinion"
Saucony Grid 8000,4okxgc,"Nope, I decided to hold out for a different pair instead."
Saucony Grid 8000,6e85gv,The materials look crazy on these üòç
Saucony Grid 8000,6e85gv,I saw these once at a Ross near me for $45. They were a size smaller than what I normally wear. I regret not getting them and just letting the laces out all loose.
Saucony Grid 8000,6e85gv,i need that salmon-looking color in my rotation. 
Saucony Grid 8000,6e85gv,How do the grid 8000's fit size wise?
Saucony Grid 8000,6e85gv,"They are great. Super comfortable as well. I managed to get mine for retail, now the summer has come around they're getting their fair share of wear too "
Saucony Grid 8000,6e85gv,"they are. not sure what material is on the toe, textured and feels super rubbery, but the construction of the shoe is awesome and the suede is so soft "
Saucony Grid 8000,8ef2kg,Picked these up for like $50 a few months ago and now I have four Grid 8000s lol very underrated shoe
Saucony Grid 8000,8ef2kg,Where can I buy these?

Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"Dope dope! Love mine, haven't left my feet since I picked them up at Footpatrol."
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"Hows the comfort on these compared to your other shoes? Do you own GLV? Just wondering because I wanna cop soon

Edit: The Only In Tokyo apparel line is still up in full size run on the beams webstore, you have to use a Japanese proxy though

Love these so much

Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,Wearing grid 9000's right now. Insanely comfortable. Definitely bit by the saucony bug.

Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"shoes are horrible they look really stupid and youre stupid for having them

come home from work im not sure if I can fill out anymore job applications"
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"Thanks! I struck out when Footpatrol first dropped them because my bank declined the purchase... Luckily, Premier opened phone orders last Saturday. Made maybe 50 attempts to call them until they finally answered."
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,I'll get some asap
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"I havent worn them for a full day yet. But comparing them to trying on a pair of GLVs, theyre mad cozy, but dont amount to a Glv"
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"Was thinking of buying them of that site, but with a proxy it ended up being almost 200. Might just wait awhile until prices fall on eBay "
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"Retail $160. I spent about an hour making attempts to call the store, but somehow still prevailed. "
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,Wow thank u
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,Go to bed dummy
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"to be fair the GLV is pretty hard to beat haha, what's the GRID system feels like on foot?"
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,holy crap that's expensive? did you try from-japan?

Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"For real, are there any shoes that compare to GLV? 

GLV > pure BOOSTS > LUNARLON
edit: pure boost"
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"Yeah that was the proxy I tried, the charge two is where they get you, it was 60 dollars extra for shipping and fees "

Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"I haven't owned any boost shoe so I dunno, but the GLV is by far the comfiest thing I own"
Saucony Grid 8000,40y45s,"I havent owned a pair of Ultras, so maybe I am speaking out of turn. Pure boost is definitely behind GLVs in terms of all day comfort. "

Air Foamposite One,ib53y4,Beautiful! Not enough foams on this sub.
Air Foamposite One,ib53y4,Those are nice. I‚Äôve been wanting the Habanero color way for a while now but I don‚Äôt think they make them anymore.
Air Foamposite One,ib53y4,I haven‚Äôt seen a pair of foams in a while. These used to be an NYC staple lmao
Air Foamposite One,ib53y4,Nothing beats a pair of foams in my eyes :‚Äô) ‚úäüèº

Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,Wow. That colorway works very well.
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,That definitely a cop for me. That color way is dope af
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,the Ice Sole needs to make a more regular appearance in the retro re-release scene. 100%
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,These are hard fr
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,[deleted]
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,Would cop if they were 95s lol
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,I am in on these this colorway just works so well...
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,"Looks real clean, just wish 97‚Äôs weren‚Äôt the most uncomfortable shoe in existence"
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,Not sure. Was browsing sneaker news sites and saw these. Definitely on my radar though.
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,They aren't. Trust me there are tons out there that are more uncomfortable
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,not even close to that
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,Uncomfortable how?
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,Ehh they‚Äôre pretty bad
Air Foamposite One,bpbryz,"I own 4 pairs of 97s and none of them have made my feet hurt after extensive wear. On the contrary, I‚Äôve worn my silver bullets to NYC and walked around for 10 hours in them. Its one of my *more* comfortable shoes tbh."

Air Foamposite One,bdgg55,Love foams! I only have the Eggplants. Would love these.
Air Foamposite One,bdgg55,I wish Nike would sell these where I live
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,"Do I wanna know how much the ""Alternate Galaxy"" will be... "
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,[fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-QYRITpXrY)
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,I'm usually not a big fan of foamposites but these actually look really good!
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,I love foams and I love the galaxy colorways. I wonder if these will sell like the originals
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,2014 Kohl's sweatshirt
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,As i never got the chance to cop the original Galaxies these will do nicely
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,These should come with the new Magic City jersey 
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,I‚Äôm getting 2012 flashbacks lmao 
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,Resale‚Äôs gonna be sooooo muchüò´
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,in my opinion these look better than the OG Galaxy foams
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,I love the colour mix. It looks really fucking cool with the black soles and uppers.
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,"I like foams but I only cop certain ones. The only pair I copped 2017 was the OG none of the other really got me hyped, but these and the abalone got me excited."
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,"I hate Foam‚Äôs, and still aren‚Äôt a fan of these but will admit them to being on of the better CW‚Äôs!"
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,Fire
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,If these are a hyperstrike... They may not cause 2012 pandemonium but they'll be a problem 
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,I just wish these had translucent soles as well
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,Wow... all of a sudden I like Foamposites 
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,[deleted]
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,"Pretty sure Sneaker Bar Detroit said they'll be $230, but I don't think anything is confirmed yet"
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XB1BENAUWo
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,The Galaxy Foamposites are the only Foamposites I‚Äôd rock. 
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,"Nike going back to being more limited, another galaxy foam, allstar release... Yeah these are going to fly and go for a good amount for resell. "
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,Or those tights that trashy girls used to wear a couple years ago with the galaxy on them(likely also from Khol's.)
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,I think visually they're better but the execution of concept was better on the original (that glow sole was strong)
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,Most likely $250-275. Nike usually charges more for the AllStar foams. 
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,Hey my friend used to wear those...
Air Foamposite One,7miz47,I have some had news buddy
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,So hyped to grab them next Saturday 
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,"i have the 09's, but the last time i wore them the sole separated. seems like it would be an easy fix on foams but i haven't tried yet."
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,One of my absolute favorites 
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,foams are my favorite nike shoe i've ever bought. I got the blue ones like a year or so ago. wish i had money to cop these eggplants
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,"gosh these are so cool. if i had to choose a favorite colorway on the foamposites, it'd be these. Dope shoe."
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,The Royal pair are super dope.  Definitely the colorway to get if you're only gonna get 1
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,They look awkward on feet though 
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,My review of these: http://www.allaboutanthony.com/nike-air-foamposite-one-eggplant-review/
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,Are they releasing them again?
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,I heard that they pushed the release date to mid August 
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,Probably can do the whole barge cement thing like on AJXIs
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,Thanks they kind of get an iridescent vibe in certain lighting
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,Link?
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,"i've never had to repair a pair of 11's so idk what that is.

i'm guessing if i just stripped the soles all the way off and cleaned them then glued them it would be be fine.

you're talking about this stuff?

https://www.amazon.com/Barge-50-2129-Parent-All-Purpose-Cement/dp/B01MCYXY6R"
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,No link just word of mouth. Might be wrong but my source is pretty reliable
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,"u gotta get the one that comes in a green can.  pretty much only on ebay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthmBQkS-pQ"
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,"None of the news sites have updated anything, all say the 29th. I know the Island Greens were pushed back significantly, September I think, and then there are the metallic gold and the women only ones in the coming months too, but I haven't seen anything on the eggplants. We will see though"
Air Foamposite One,6oo6ei,"thanks
"
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,Nice timbs.
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,I wanted these too but got mad it was only a release in Asia.  I am looking forward for this one to come stateside.  Where did you grab these from?
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,Timberfoams.
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"I'm in asia :p Malaysia to be specific. This year has been a good year for sneakers here. We managed to get the What The LeBrons a full 3 months before it was released state side (I didn't get it because I loss the Ballot) and I posted the Grey/Volt Air Jordan Futures which was also released waaaay before stateside.
"
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,Are these sitting on shelves down there?
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"They look nice for sure. Not janky. 

Idk about them tho. I mean I'd definitely pickup for under  200 lol"
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"Damn, these joints fresh asf."
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"So much hate in this shoe before, now everybody wants em. I  I like em its decent"
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"Well it kind of makes up for Nike Malaysia NOT releasing the Triple Black Foams, which I REALLY wanted."
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"The thing is, I know that these are suede because real timbs are suede blah blah blah...but if these had normal foamposite shell these would be the most badass and functional winter shoes ever. Normal foams are built like tanks but the suede is pussy and will get bad when wet"
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"An abomination, IMO. "
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"I'm in the same boat. Hopefully they'll come over soon and be an easy cop. Seems like a pretty divisive shoe, but I love em "
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"Well, they just came out today, and there is quite a bit of stock left last I checked."
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,"I think the hate was for the pros, cause I think they look MUCH cleaner without the swoosh. Might actually buy a pair myself. "
Air Foamposite One,2hiop1,I wanted a pair sooo bad. Good pickup man. Do you know any information on when they drop in the states?
Air Foamposite One,186peh,Bought these too.  Really nice shoe in person  
Air Foamposite One,186peh,I bought a pair in the wrong size in hopes of funding a pair in my real size. 
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"Walked in, scooped the display with no sales tax! They are pretty dynamic, and I'm excited to fit them out.

Never thought I would rock a foam, but that bug hit me **so hard** when I saw there was no tax."
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"I bought them, but I put them up on eBay. Not because I want to make money, but I really want to get some gold medal KD 4's and need the money to buy them. Love these Fighter Jets though. Breaks my heart to sell them. If nobody takes my set price I might just keep them."
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"I just got these, Cant wait for them to come in. They look so sick."
Air Foamposite One,186peh,Im so sad that when I tried to buy these they sold out the second I hit add to cart ):
Air Foamposite One,186peh,[deleted]
Air Foamposite One,186peh,What size did you buy / what are you looking for?
Air Foamposite One,186peh,So you actually did buy them to make money.
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"For real who cares if you resell one pair once in a while, it's not like you're coming home with 8 pair putting them all on ebay. Keep them of sell them, you either get a beautiful shoe or a lot of cash"
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"I did the same thing, but to add to my Jordan collection.  I like these, and was tempted to keep them, but I got a great deal on a pair of J's I wanted.  The profits from these helped cover that.

I dont resell just to make money, but whatever profit I do make goes right back in to my shoe game.  

Now if I could snag the metallic reds I wouldn't be selling those."
Air Foamposite One,186peh,...what size you looking for?
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"There's that info, and more in the side bar. HTH"
Air Foamposite One,186peh,I got a size 13 and am looking for an 11 or an 11.5.
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"Theoretically, but I'd accept a trade. I'm not in it to make a business or a profit, I just want a different sneaker. Plus I'm not even sold on that. I saw more on-feet pics and I'm in love with the Fighter Jets. I'll honestly probably keep them. I have never bought and will never buy a release that I wouldn't wear myself. I bought these knowing that I'll want to keep them unless I have the opportunity to get the gold medals."
Air Foamposite One,186peh,I dunno I think getting a shoe for trade bait isn't quite as bad as straight reselling
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"13, cause I don't think they made them in 14 (at least I haven't seen them anywhere)"
Air Foamposite One,186peh,People already have them up on SC/ISS. Maybe you could trade a reseller for the size you want vs. the size you got. They're gonna sell them anyway.
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"You bought the shoes with your hard-earned money just like anyone else, you are free to do what you want with them. It just seemed in your original post, you didn't want to be outright called a reseller. They are beautiful shoes."
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"I am in no position whatsoever to throw shots at anyone for their choices, I just feel like kromatikk was trying to justify reselling, which again is his decision."
Air Foamposite One,186peh,[deleted]
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"I'll never understand this viewpoint.  If you feel a certain way, it should be towards Nike/JB for releasing such limited quantities.  If they didn't intentionally release like enough pairs to only satisfy like 1/4 of their demand, there would be no reseller market and sneakers wouldn't be considered a commodity.

If someone is lining up earlier than you and/or clicking their mouse faster than you, there's no reason to be mad at them.  Nobody is ""stealing money from you"" and nobody is ""abusing the market"".  Resellers are treating a commodity EXACTLY how a commodity should be treated.  If the people that are just in it for the shoes are mad, those feelings should be towards the companies that created the market, not those that are smart enough to work harder to get their shoes and smart enough to profit off of them.  "
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"You really think Nike shot callers said ""hey, I was on eBay and these resellers are charging way too much"". No, some bean counter said ""we made ______ off tht last run and we could make a lotta profit next month if order another batch since laor and material cost are so low right now, Nike doesn't give a shit, they just want their peso like every reseller. "
Air Foamposite One,186peh,You act like that's all that happens. I saw a dude hustling 6 little kids at the mall to walk out with eight pairs of 11's a couple of weeks ago. You're telling me that's ok?
Air Foamposite One,186peh,That was sarcastic. Guess I should have made that more clear.
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"If they got in line before you and each adhered to the 1 per customer, per trip rule, then yes that's perfectly ok.  Six people lining up to get sneakers is six people.  I doesn't matter if they're sneaker heads or resellers.  I guarantee the store you purchased from had a lot more than 8 pairs, so if these people affected you, it simply means that you didn't get there early enough.  If someone's willing to show up at 2am and camp out overnight, the person that strolls up at 7am (not saying this is you) has no business to get pissy over their intentions.  

I can certainly understand why you guys feel this way, but the reason these feelings are coming out is because you're treating sneakers as if they're some magical product as opposed to every other material product in the US economy.  If you want to get mad, then it really needs to be at Nike/JB.  The only reason this is even happening is because they release extremely limited quantities intentionally.  Doing this creates hype and hype creates a marketplace. It's no different coins, precious metals, or any other type of collectable.  Would you get mad at a person that goes around from garage sale to garage sale purchasing old furniture if you knew that they were an antique dealer and looking to stock up their store?  Would you get mad at the person that finds a silver dollar and sells is for $33 in silver, instead of just using it to buy a soda? Of course you wouldn't.  

My basic point here is that Nike/JB has turned sneakers into a commodity by withholding production.  You guys may have a certain emotional attachment to sneakers, but that doesn't mean that you're anymore entitled to them than people that purchase them for other reasons.  Simply put, if you want them for retail, you need to show up REALLY early or be really quick with that mouse click, and that's 100% the fault of Nike/JB, not the resellers.  

The funniest part of this argument is that most sneaker heads don't even realize how lucky they are that resellers exist.  Let's assume there is no reseller market whatsoever.  Nike/JB puts out a limited edition shoe and everyone waiting on line or on the site is a legitimate sneaker collector.  These sell out in 40 minutes online instead of 20 and you can get them for approx 2 hours at the store instead of 1 hour.  Now everyone that has these sneakers loves them and will either wear them religiously or will stock them and never touch them.  Ok, now lets say you missed this release for whatever reason and you really want a pair.  Since there are no resellers and every single pair went to a collector, where do you think you're going to get them from?  Sure, you might not be fond of resellers marking up the shoes, but at least they're giving you a secondary market and another chance to get a release that you want.  "
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"I don't really want to put too much effort into writing paragraphs, but I'll address some points.

1. Your examples don't quite work.

2. I can't believe that you think the kid story is alright. He paid little kids to stand in line with him in order to scoop up more sneakers. That's sort of disturbing.

3. I don't really mind Nike making the shoes limited. Makes it more special to actually own them.

4. I don't have an issue with the whole concept of reselling, but it goes too far. Making a business out of it? Hustling little kids?"
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"1.  My examples absolutely do work. They're all goods that are worth a certain price initially, but are then bought with the intent to place them onto a secondary market for profit.  The only reason they don't work for you is because you're having trouble separating sneakers from every other commodity because of the emotional attachment.

2.  Ok, so it's ""hustling"" little kids if you're paying them to stand in line for you.  Is this also the case if you're paying them to mow your lawn, shovel your snow, etc?   I obviously have no idea about the specific situation, but if he's giving them money in exchange for standing somewhere for a couple of hours, they were probably extremely happy with that.  He offered them pay in exchange for doing a job, which is more sensical than some of you guys are with the ""please wait in line all morning, then sell them to me for retail plus shipping"" bullshit. 

3.  I completely understand this, but when ANYTHING is limited, it creates a secondary market and turns that item into a commodity.  It's a matter of not having your cake and eating it too.  If you want something that's super limited, there will always be a secondary market and resellers 100% of the time. 

4.  Why is making a business out of it wrong?  You're doing something that's completely legal.  You have the means to get stock at a god price if you're willing to make the right connections or put in enough effort and there's a consistent after market where you can make decent margins on certain shoes.  That's not ""going too far"", it's just being smart and entrepreneurial.  Like I've said a million times, Nike/JB is to blame for this.  They release limited quantities of shoes with the intent of creating hype and a secondary market.  Because they're doing this, they know that their product will become a commodity and more sought after.  It's a genius marketing tactic on their part in a pure business sense, but if you're going to be mad at anyone, it should be them, because they're doing it on purpose specifically for this reason.  You guys are just brainwashed into being mad at the resellers because you hold Nike/JB too sacred in your minds.  "
Air Foamposite One,186peh,"They don't work because those items are purchased/found for below retail value and then marked up. I won't get into it though, whatever works for you.

Again, I don't mind reselling when the person camps out for the shoes like everyone else. But things are getting out of hand as far as a select amount of people getting a high amount of pairs to sell. Feels like I'm repeating myself.

It's more ethics than anything, and I'm not calling for anyone to get arrested. I simply complained about the state of the secondary market. You're making this something that it's not.

Not to mention that you assume that I have an emotional attachment towards sneakers, while in fact my emotional attachment to money is probably higher.

This argument is going in circles, and I'm not going to continue with it. All that was ever said is that the state of the secondary market is shit. Nike isn't to be blamed for it. I'm willing to take the shitty system in return for exclusivity.

You're getting way too worked up over this. ""You guys are just brainwashed into being mad at the resellers because you hold Nike/JB too sacred in your minds,"" is probably the saddest statement I've ever read on this site. You act like you're better because you're not ""brainwashed"" by Nike. Get real for a second. Every item you own is comparable simply due to capitalism. It's a pile of bullshit."

Air Foamposite One,2y1w76,"You and me both (give or take, several thousand other people)."
Air Foamposite One,2y1w76,They released two weeks ago on the SNKRS app.
Air Foamposite One,2y1w76,"man you don't need to explain anything wear what you like bruh, im tired of people getting their panties in a bunch about pics, if you don't like the pic keep it moving and don't comment. enjoy the shoes is what its all about."
Air Foamposite One,2y1w76,It's just all too loud. I mean gold is almost as loud as it gets (the chrome posites are probably the most) so when you add in more gold it just becomes something else. 
Air Foamposite One,2y1w76,haha
Air Foamposite One,2y1w76,Really? Which country?
Air Foamposite One,2y1w76,US
Air Foamposite One,143w61,The only reason I did not cop is because they really fucked up the sole last year. I mean look you can see the glue marks on the inside.
Air Foamposite One,143w61,what size
Air Foamposite One,143w61,Let me guess op you live in the DMV area?
Air Foamposite One,143w61,"I hear ya on that. The glue is visible in quite a few areas. My original ones were flawless back in the day, that is until I decided to take a black Sharpie to the upper and give myself the first ever stealth foamposite haha"
Air Foamposite One,143w61,"13, and if you're wondering, yes, that bright blue shell looks huge on my foot haha"
Air Foamposite One,143w61,Born and raised in NY. Just an old sneakerhead who happened to be a big Penny fan growing. These are the only Foamposites I like. Forget all those new fruit loop colorways.  
Air Foamposite One,143w61,Haha still a beautiful shoe overall.
Air Foamposite One,143w61,"Sick foams. They are just ""Royal Blue"" though. There's nothing neon about em."
Air Foamposite One,143w61,Ok I just know up here not a day passes that I don't see these shoes. Its been that way for a decade.
Air Foamposite One,143w61,"Thanks. You're right, there's nothing neon about them, however, dark neon royal is the official color, unless the DK on the box stands for Donkey Kong :)
"
Air Foamposite One,143w61,"Huh, crazy. I honestly thought the originals were just royal, guess you learn something every day :D"
Air Foamposite One,4atnci,Holy shit. Those are incredible 
Air Foamposite One,4atnci,"Aaaah I'm so conflicted!
On the one hand those look fly AF.
On the other hand I haaate foamposites. They look so cheap most of the time."
Air Foamposite One,4atnci,what pants are those?
Air Foamposite One,4atnci,Str8 heat
Air Foamposite One,4atnci,like you're wearing armor for your feet lmfao
Air Foamposite One,4atnci,Same bro. This is the *first* pair of foams Ive seen that didnt look like plastic imo. These are pretty sweet though.
Air Foamposite One,4atnci,They're some GAP Skinnies
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,Hope they dont get hyped up
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,Alright it's a date 
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,Best bday gift in a long time
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,"This is going to be an insanely hyped release that's going to sell out instantly and have a high resale price.  Foams fly off the shelves anyway, but the very first colorway getting retroed on the 20th anniversary is going to add to it. 

For me, it's an instant cop. "
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,"Friday the 13th, I can already taste that L."
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,"Stupid question, but what's the logo on the soles?"
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,"Too late.
"
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,A penny logo I think.
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,"This is correct.
These shoes were originally designed for Anfernee Hardaway aka Penny Hardaway. The logo consists of his number with the cent sigh in front of it. 
Fun Fact, his grandmother used to call him ""Pretty"" all the time, and being from the south it came out sounding like ""Penny"". So Penny became his nickname. "
Air Foamposite One,5a4jia,This is also correct.
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"Looks cool, I'd just get them because I'm into astrophotography."
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,I'm sure they look better in person but I'm not impressed by these. I'll definitely be passing.
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,Not sure if i feel it or not. 
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,Looks like an airbrush custom gone wrong
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,Those are very pretty shoes
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"I actually really like these. Might be the only one, but I do like em!"
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"I always feel they do these wacky designs only on foams (Paranormans, Bloody Tampon, Galaxy, etc) Cool but its on a foam which is already hard to rock for most people. "
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"these look like something a clown would wear (literally, not figuratively)"
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,Ooo shit these are ugly 
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"Foamposite colorways like this and the ""weathermans"" are downright childish. I love collecting sneakers but don't want to look like a child wearing them. "
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"I said the same thing about the holograms. They looked so nice in pictures then when I saw them in person they were such a let down. You put them on the floor and it's basically just a grey shoe. 

The 11's had more pop to them and it wasn't even the whole shoe that had that glittery effect."
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,Can't the Sakuras be considered the bloody tampons?
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"I really like my holograms actually but yeah, you definitely have to account for what a shoe or piece of clothing will look like when you're wearing it as part of an outfit. It's very different than when you see it on a shelf."
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,You mean the 13s?
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,They both are 
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"Yeah that's what I mean. When it's in your face the effect is real cool but once on the floor you really have to be looking for it to actually see it.

I think even the gone fishing effect was more pronounced. 

Not putting down the shoe I thought it was amazing just my own opinion. "
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,Nah I was talking about the patent leather on the 72-10's. They just stand out more than the whole shoe of the hologram foams.
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,"Sure, sure. Please don't apologize for your opinion.

Yeah, those Gone Fishings...mmmm I'm sad I missed out on them. We don't get green foams too often.

Nike seems really interested in trying to get the reflective material or paint down. They keep trying to get the mirror effect to work whether it's on the mirror foams, the blue mirrors, or the holograms. Once they work it out it'll be fire, but I'm not gonna pay 275 for something that's going to chip and fade after 4-6 wears."
Air Foamposite One,41qadh,Yeah and to be on a shoe that most people call indestructible is a super let down.
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"damn aren't these one of the rarer cws of foams? (I'm the only person in Baltimore, foam central, that doesn't like them that much)"
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,They look good.
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"To each his own, for sure, but personally I find this style of shoe to be aesthetically lacking at best. I must be missing something surely. What aspect of this shoe creates such a desirability? "
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Reminds me a lot of the green Half Cents. Sharp shit.
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"damn, I've never seen these before. I dig. congrats."
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"People like foams for comfort. Not to mention they are amazing to actually play in. So for people asking what the desirability is, it's the fact that these are comfortable. I own a few pair myself."
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Still overrated shoes
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"I personally love foams, and this color way is sickkk"
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"if im not wrong these are ""cactus"" foams "
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"Cw's? Sorry, didn't pick up on that one."
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Hey! A fellow Baltimoron!
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,thanks man!
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Hype.
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Thanks bro.
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"In this case you are, these are the HoH foams, the cactus joints are a solid sole pair and more yellow."
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"Cactus sole is opaque while the HoH are semi transparent

source: i paint n shit"
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,You are wrong - these are the Neo Limes that released in the latter part of 2011. The Cactus (2007 release) has a solid-colored outsole (not translucent) and was a brighter hue of green.
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Color ways
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,yessir! I'm out Towson 
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Yep.
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"'spensive. 
"
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"Just realized, haha! And yeah, they are pretty scarce."
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"Nice. I lived in around Columbia ( Fulton, to be more specific), but moved to south Texas a couple years ago. Spent most of my time in Dundalk tho."
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Damn. I'm in Dundalk a lot too haha. is your username referencing Ray Lewis? 
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,Of course! I hope your a Ravens fan lol.
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"absolutely. I'm actually working for a valet parking service recently, and we're working the Ravens ring ceremony tonight. "
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"Wow thats awesome, where is it at?"
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"The Castle, aka their facility in Owings Mills"
Air Foamposite One,1fu5lq,"Oh, should have known that. So how do you think we are going to fare this year? WR is our biggest question, Torrey needs to step up and Jacoby needs to be more than an amazing return man..."
Air Foamposite One,6871lx,"I used to really be into Foams, but my interest has kinda faded. I have 3 and i'm pretty happy with those tho i'd like a purple pair"
Air Foamposite One,6871lx,"Another classic colorway of the Nike Air Foamposite One will be returning this year to help celebrate the model‚Äôs 20 year anniversary. We just got word that the Nike Air Foamposite One Metallic Red will be getting the retro treatment this year, but what makes this announcement so surprising is the fact that shoe will be release in a matter of weeks. Yup, no time wasted huh, Nike?"
Air Foamposite One,6871lx,I remember when it was like 1-2 colorways of foams per year. Then they flooded the market and killed the foams. And didn't these release not too long ago? Damn Nike just retro'ing everything now lol
Air Foamposite One,6871lx,foams are done and over
Air Foamposite One,41du5u,I got a pair for $100 at an outlet a few years back..one of my fav pairs..nice shot op

Air Foamposite One,41du5u,Not the cough drop this is the varsity red pair....... cough drop is the one with the translucent sole
Air Foamposite One,41du5u,God I want those so bad I've wanted them ever since they came out but couldn't afford it at the time 
Air Foamposite One,41du5u,"Thanks, yea people slept on these hard, I had 2 pair at one point thanks to a 20% off Nike clearance sale back in the day."
Air Foamposite One,41du5u,H&m - thanks!
Air Foamposite One,41du5u,It is translucent 
Air Foamposite One,41du5u,oh it is damn it looks matte
Air Foamposite One,41du5u,yea odd lighting the other day

Air Foamposite One,4uq65v,I mean if they weren't $250...
Air Foamposite One,4uq65v,I miss when foams used to be this nice
Air Foamposite One,4uq65v,Don't worry you can get them for way more from a reseller
Air Foamposite One,4uq65v,Yeah pretty price. I'd buy for 140-160. Great design though.
Air Foamposite One,4uq65v,...but this just released today..so they are this nice...
Air Foamposite One,4uq65v,this is the first one in a long time. Plus the fucking price takes away from it.
Air Foamposite One,46spv7,"I don't see the hate of foam posites I personally like them and have a pair, just a bit hard to rock gl!"
Air Foamposite One,46spv7,"I will admit I don't like ALL foams. I love these and the 'Yeezy solar' ones. Those are the only ones I have. I want the 'Red Octobers', Galaxy, Gucci, and possibly the white Gucci, but I'm not sure (tried em on and they were uncomfortable as shit, or else I would have bought them, but they look so damn badass). Those are the only ones on my list, as of now. But, it gets updated practically every day lol!  Any ones that you like that I could add to my list?"
Air Foamposite One,46spv7,"U covers most I like, I like the mirrors as a look itself just hard to rock like I said"
Air Foamposite One,46spv7,I had the glaxy and the print didn't pop as much as people think and i was a little disappointed 
Air Foamposite One,46spv7,"Dude, those mirrors are awesome! Already put em on my list. Thanks man!"
Air Foamposite One,46spv7,"No shit? They look so beautiful in pics! So, not worth the money, in your opinion?"
Air Foamposite One,46spv7,"Imo they aren't worth that hyped price, i paid 980 and it really wasn't worth that but better than the Doernbecher foams, they weren't as bright as i thought either. Its like every picture is edited making them pop like crazy
"
Air Foamposite One,7463cy,Thinking about picking some of these up on payday. How comfortable are they?
Air Foamposite One,7463cy,"Pretty comfortable, just need to make sure you get the right size otherwise they'll kill you. "
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,I would love to have these. Could you tell me what time that translates to?
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,Gonna try to see if I can cop them while at work ha. Pretty sure its gonna be impossible but its worth a shot.
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,Any idea if the SNKRS app is going to have it as well? Thanks.
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,Are these going to be 220 or 250?
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,10 AM.
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,"~~7PM EST.~~

edit: downvoting myself. Forgot that the times that Nike uses are in GMT. I never really look at the times anymore.

/u/Play_GG-XRD is correct. It's 10AM EST."
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,"It hasn't parsed on their server(s) yet, so not sure. Usually it does around the same time."
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,250
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,Could you tell me how you came with this conversion . 
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,"7 pm EST? 

So tomorrow 4 pm PST. Gotcha thanks"
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,http://imgur.com/TNYeTZX
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,"The 24 hour clock that Nike uses runs on GMT, I forgot that. His time is correct. 10 AM EST."
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,"8AM PST, 10AM EST. I forgot that the parsed servers run on GMT."
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,"Im sorry in advance, but if you'll allow me to be super, incredibly  nerdy for a second...

It's eDt, and also its in UTC, not gmt. GMT is a timezone and UTC is the standard that computers or othee devices use when communicating with one another. More or less. 
I can't help myself."
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,Don't you mean 7AM PST?
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,"lol fuckin up all the times today, aren't ya?
haha its 7AM."
Air Foamposite One,37nzq9,"Oh, I'm aware... Just seemed it would be better to explain via the time zone rather than the coordinated time. One being more universally used in conversation over the other.. "
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,"Congrats, look good. :)."
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,[deleted]
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,Nice man. How much did you pay?
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,Thank you :)
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,"Not right now. I'm currently off at college, because of supreme's rules they had to be shipped to my billing address back home. I won't get to touch them for a month :("
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,I got them off of supreme.com so retail + shipping + state tax = 280.
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,"Ahh, I thought it was resale. How did you get em? They sold out right away."
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,"No bot either!

Honestly, I was quick + I used 2 chrome extensions, Page Monitor and lastpass. If you want, I'll elaborate further."
Air Foamposite One,22k75t,Yeah I really want the yeezy foams any advice would be great!
Air Foamposite One,1lkj31,"god dammit stealths are fly, nice man!"
Air Foamposite One,1lkj31,Should say Air Max 1 QS ofc. 
Air Foamposite One,1lkj31,"ive been on the lookout for stealths at a decent price forever, how muchc did you get those for? nice fuckin kicks"
Air Foamposite One,1lkj31,Yeah! Actually one of the few cw's of Foams that i really like :)
Air Foamposite One,1lkj31,"Got them for retail on day of release on NDC. Retail prices in sweden are stupid high though, about $ 330. 
 "
Air Foamposite One,1lkj31,"me too man, me too. Dont own any foams as yet but when I can get these for a good price they will be my first"
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,"If you don't mind me asking, how'd you get them?"
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,Great upside down :(
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,Fuck these new foams are just Turrible
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,Can you upload more detailed pics of the weathermans? Really on the fence with these 
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,I like the innevas. What colorway are they?
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,Are those the official box? I haven't seen a white box outside the floral solar soft moccasins. 
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,How did you get those???
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,http://i.imgur.com/Ap0veQu.jpg
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,"Just a guess, but I think NSW Premium releases now come in white boxes. I think the Floral Solar Softs were Premium."
Air Foamposite One,1kx5qs,Yeah They have an embossed Futura logo as well. I hate how nike is switching boxes up again
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,Why the Fuck
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,"Ewww, no thank you."
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,"http://imgur.com/bQjgxW7

Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,"As ugly as these are, get ready for riots. "
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,"Not a fan.

I'll sit back and watch the hype rise."
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,ew
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,Shoe would be fire with a different sole.  Will cop and dye that shit
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,I thought it was a shitty custom at first..
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,"Seeing the whole shoe makes them look even worse. At least the other ""Concord"" Nike shoes like the SB one had the patent leather. "
Air Foamposite One,22fhcr,a foam would look hideous with patent leather
Air Foamposite One,2l0w5p,Are you whoopi Goldberg ?
Air Foamposite One,2l0w5p,nice af
Air Foamposite One,2l0w5p,one of my fav colorways. i break necks everytime i wear them

Air Foamposite One,167457,Also does anyone know how much these usually are?
Air Foamposite One,167457,[deleted]
Air Foamposite One,167457,220 is retail then after they release the resale price goes up then drops after a few weeks back to around retail. The metallic reds were the first release to be at 220 now the fighter jets are going to be 235. 
Air Foamposite One,4yfok2,I personally am not a fan of these foams but this is still a really nice pickup. Hope you enjoy them.
Air Foamposite One,4yfok2,Yeezy Yeezy what's good 
Air Foamposite One,4yfok2,The shoes!
Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,"I don't care how much hype there is around these shoes, I must have them. "
Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,It's a tough time to be an Arizona sports fan but these make it a little bit better. 
Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,I can already see people lining up for their raffle ticket.
Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,This is a must.
Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,Must cop.
Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,I want these. I want these so much. Hopefully these will be my first pair of Foamposites.

Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,The hype is strong with this one...
Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,I'm a huge Suns fan as well so these are a must. Do you live in the Phoenix area by any chance? I'm going out there at the end of the month and I need to find a couple places to buy some kicks/streetwear.

Air Foamposite One,14nr9m,"I don't currently live in Phoenix but I did for the last 5 years. I'm not sure what you are looking for as far as shops but a good call would be to go to high point in Scottsdale it's owned by Adrian Wilson of the AZ cardinals. High point gets a lot of heat and stuff just sits around, last time i was there was about a year ago and i bought a pair of cough drop foams for 150 in my size. After you hit up high point go to the Scottsdale fashion square for house of hoops and industrial skate shop (if your looking for obey/the hundreds) then go see nike town which is about a 20 min drive from Scottsdale. I hope that's helpful let me know if there's anything specific your looking for maybe I can point you in the right direction. "

Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,Sick waterbottle...these look nicer worn
Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,I saw your same pic different pose on sole protectors ig.
Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,Where did you cop the water bottle??
Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,"supremenewyork.com/shop

They sold out day of release, then again when they restocked."
Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,"The thirst for this waterbottle reminds me of this article I read the other day. I don't necessarily agree with everything she wrote but still an interesting take.

http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2013/09/dating-a-sneakerhead/"
Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,I had a feeling that would be the only site to buy that. I might as well search around eBay....thanks
Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,Just put a Supreme sticker on a Nalgene. 
Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,"as a pretty avid supreme collector, this is the better idea. I was going to cop the waterbottle, but ive heard that the lettering chips pretty easily. I just throw a box logo sticker on and call it a day."
Air Foamposite One,23yrjc,LOL--not a bad idea either...

Air Foamposite One,1rbiic,How did he cop them?
Air Foamposite One,1rbiic,galaxies and paranormans just stepped down in a lot of people's books.
Air Foamposite One,1rbiic,"""Not his personal pair"" according to him, pretty sure they belong to a friend."
Air Foamposite One,1r190a,If I may ask... How? I'm still really debating on it :/
Air Foamposite One,1r190a,How are they quality wise?
Air Foamposite One,1r190a,"I know they have them at kicksole, I've been debating on getting these too"
Air Foamposite One,1r190a,Foam quality never really changes.
Air Foamposite One,1r190a,"^^ Exactly, foamposites generally always have the same quality. I was hoping for a more textured feel to the safari print, but I'm not complaining."
Air Foamposite One,1r190a,So it's the same as the other painted foams?
Air Foamposite One,4wj643,Pretty sure they don't make reps of these so you good
Air Foamposite One,4wj643,"I'm still on the fence about them. The penny sign doesn't match with the foamposites I do have authentic. Also, about 3-4 glue marks on the pair. The holes for the shoe strings was not even cut properly. Of course it could have been manufacturing problems but I think I'm just gonna play it safe and return them. "
Air Foamposite One,21wzs6,who's feeling which? that red is fire
Air Foamposite One,21wzs6,"10,000% will need a bot to cop "
Air Foamposite One,21wzs6,Why does everyone think you need a bot to cop? All you need is a little bit of swiftness. Im copping without a bot.
Air Foamposite One,21wzs6,"Everyone thinks that you need a bot to cop because the Supreme online store doesn't reserve your shoe for you (i.e does not reserve it when you put it in the cart).  

Being cart jacked will happen if you don't got at least autofill with all of your CC# info on your browser so you can checkout with the quickness.

Air Foamposite One,2a5vd0,i was going to say the same thing haha.  best title ive ever seen on here....Ducks fly together
Air Foamposite One,1tama4,These are so fucking sexy. I want them so bad but i dont have any money. 
Air Foamposite One,1tama4,WANT!
Air Foamposite One,1tama4,Is any place other than Nike selling these?
Air Foamposite One,1tama4,I work for Nike and these are the first time I've seen these 0_o
Air Foamposite One,1tama4,When do the Oregon 5s come out?
Air Foamposite One,1tama4,could this be a nike dot com release?
Air Foamposite One,1tama4,Wow I want to cop these to rock... Those soles are too nice.
Air Foamposite One,1tama4,Oregon is getting crazy advertising out of these things. It's almost not fair. 
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,"Can you get a better shot from the back? That's one surefire way to check Foams, but they look a little wonky in the album."
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,Here are some [more pictures](http://imgur.com/a/Zz9OI).
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,"Yep, I think you're good!"
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,Yep they're real. No need to worry.
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,"Wonderful. I got them from a reputable eBay seller in Belgium, but you can never be too sure with aftermarket purchases. 

Do you mind explaining what things you looked for to LC? "
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,"The three things I usually check for on foams is the toe stitching, carbon fiber, and the shape of the back. The two front stitches should be tight and holding the foamposite material close together, not all spread out and loose.The carbon fiber should look like actual carbon fiber with a slightly rough texture and square-ish shape. Fake carbon fiber is usually a piece of smooth plastic with circles instead of squares.  For the back of the shoe you want a pear shape with a wide bottom and skinnier top. Fakes have more of a straight up and down back with no or little curve to them."
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,"When it comes to Foams, it's pretty easy to tell because fakes are never done well. The \#1 thing to look for is the almost ""teardrop"" shape that Foams have when viewed from behind. Fakes will *never* have this."
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,Thanks for sharing!
Air Foamposite One,2ebjmp,Thanks!
Air Foamposite One,438urz,these look legit

Air Foamposite One,438urz,"I'm talking about foamposites in general, even legit ones. "
Air Foamposite One,1tozln,"Dope imo, a lot better than the foams that have been dropping recently although i kinda like the safaris."
Air Foamposite One,1tozln,I'm surprised these cost less (albeit $10) than regular foams.
Air Foamposite One,1tozln,Are these going to be hard as hell to get?
Air Foamposite One,1tozln,Is this going to be an online or in store release?
Air Foamposite One,1tozln,"Yes, considerably more so now that the Yeezys aren't releasing, I feel that most of the people trying to pick those up to resell will focus on these now."
Air Foamposite One,3t4tsi,"Pretty sure SneakerWatch's calendar is correct, almost every site had the 27th as their first date, but then majority of them changed it to the 25th during the second-third week of October. "
Air Foamposite One,3t4tsi,"Thanks,  appreciate it. "
Air Foamposite One,1cifa2,IMO these look awful.  The foamposite texture doesn't do them justice.  The art on them seems poor too.  The weatherman theme works better for KD because of who he is and how he plays.
Air Foamposite One,1cifa2,clown shoes
Air Foamposite One,1cifa2,"Oh god, a pack full of crazy-themed foams? What is next, Facial Foamposites? Skin-colored with white splattered dots everywhere...?"
Air Foamposite One,1cifa2,Not related but why are most of your sneaker posts downvoted like they are? I thought that you downvoted stuff that didn't pertain to whatever topic/subreddit it was posted in. Serious question. 
Air Foamposite One,1cifa2,"He just spams his own blog, which is pretty frowned upon. Good etiquette is for every 10 posts you make, 1 is your own blog. This dude posts only his own blog like 3 or 4 times a day."
Air Foamposite One,1cifa2,Ahh ok. Thank you. 
Air Foamposite One,1cifa2,"You still view the posts, regardless, so you must like them."
Air Foamposite One,1cifa2,I don't open them. I just like reading the comments of every post on here though because I like the discussions.

New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,Nice

New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,Kanye vibes
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,What did these run you?
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,Thank you!
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,Ronnie Fieg never skips a beat when it comes to color blocking.
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,Do it‚Äî you won‚Äôt regret it.
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,I wouldn‚Äôt say these were slept on at all.
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,Except these soles aren‚Äôt crumbling :)
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,Retail.
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,Do you think half-size down is best?
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,I dunno I did TTS‚Äî is that what people typically recommend?
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,"For 997 I typically see half size down as the recommendation, but many say TTS is just fine."
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,After reading your comment I did some poking around and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 50/50 on peoples opinions. For me personally I wear a SZ 10.5 in Air Jordan‚Äôs and the 10.5 in the M NB 997 fits just fine. Maybe a tad bit of room up at the toes but not significant enough for me to even think about sizing down. But I also have a very large arch in my foot so everything else fits just snug and right :) hope that helps you out a bit?
New Balance 997 OG,a7i31h,"You‚Äôre the man bro, it definitely helps me out, I‚Äôm gonna go TTS

I hope you have a Merry Christmas, stay blessed "

New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,How many votes did king push lose to the qasa and prisms by? 
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"Surprised that the Coat of Arms got some love, easily one of my favorite RFs this year so that's awesome. 

Also shocked the commonwealths got good reception. I remember hearing mixed reviews here, but I really love what CW did and their production was on point. "
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,Feel free to comment as to what you liked/didn't like about the categories as well as any additional feedback here! I'm sure the next person (whether it's me or not) would appreciate being able to use my 2014 as a guide to improve for next year just as I was able to with /u/treeizle's terrific 2013.
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,I'm sure it'd be quite the task but it would be pretty cool to see a simple graph of each category just to see where other nominees landed. 
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"The most hyped release picture of the Red Octobers doesn't work for me.

Thanks for doing this. I was pretty disappointed in the Jordan releases this year."
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"The Invincible x Reebok Instapump Fury is a picture of Shaqs, ;)"
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,I think its funny that the two Reebok shoes are ones no one really posts around here (not just the collabs but the regular releases). I think the instafury is pretty hideous sneaker.
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,Glad to see those Fieg Puma's on the list. Absolutely overlooked and the mints are equally as beautiful as the salmon joints.
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,i'm really disappointed that the sl loop x wish didn't get on the collab of the year list.
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,No love for Under Armour shoes?
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,The instapump fury og should be runners up but still its cool that the instapumps up there. 
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"As I stated in the previous thread, the Gold Hypervenom Roshe Run have the wrong image. I suggest this [Image](http://4.kicksonfire.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nike-roshe-run-hyperfuse-gold-1.jpg) as the replacement. Notice the differences in the heel section. Gold Hypervenom should have the white heel."
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"I 100% agree, man. The Yeezys, Future Premiums, Kill Bills, and Embers were much nicer imo."
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"Completely agree. Too gimmicky and not special enough, IMO."
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,Came in 4th - I was surprised by Anteater beating both Space Snacks and Life on Mars.
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,Offsprings for sure in my book.  They didn't get enough love around here.  And it seems like everyone forgot about mints and coves.
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"offsprings win for sure. 

keep in mind though, this sub has a bias toward hyped releases. "
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"I was pleasantly surprised to see the Geminis as runners up. I thought they were one of the more clever shoes to come along in quite awhile. Like many great shoes, pictures don't really do them justice."
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,Back 2 back baby 
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"Me neither, they're pretty whack when you compare them to shoes with better colorways. You don't even notice the different tones of red when you're looking at them from afar. You look at them because ""Oh shit Yeezys!"". I just bought one to resell and buy better shoes. Frankly, I think it's just a shoe to flex with, nothing else."
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"Unique design by using different shades of red, clean as fuck imo with that outrageous shape."
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"The Yeezy 2s were trendsetting shoes, and the bright red colorway was the most popular option of the line. It started a trend that still persists to this day. Without the Red Octobers, maybe Fieg doesn't have an all red Filling Pieces collab. Maybe CNCPTS doesn't do the Asics GLV Ember. Maybe Nike doesn't lead with a predominantly red shoe to launch the LeBron 12 line. Nike is still getting mileage out of that colorway and design elements (case in point: the Kobe 9 KRM EXT that just dropped as recently as this month features the same bright red color and scaled texture as the Red October - and it dropped almost a full year later). The Red October really ushered in red as the new hot color in the sneaker world. You can still see the impact everywhere."
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,"I agree on the geminis, very nice imo"
New Balance 997 OG,2qokaa,Dem saucony burgers. But I didn't vote. I'd prefer the jazz pack one

Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,100% the best 4D pair made
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Bought these a few months ago. They look so clean IRL. Pretty different form everything else people wear due to the green sole.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,How do these fit? So stoked that they are bringing these back
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"How do these fit? Planning on getting these when they drop on the 19th and saw the old futurecraft 4ds fit small, which is a bit concerning since I have a fairly wide foot. Is this still true?"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Sshh I want a chance.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"Great cop. I managed to cop my pair at retail on 5 March in Asia region.

Definitely go up half a size for these as the prime knit is a tad bit tighter than the usual ultraboost 1.0 - 4.0."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Grail for me.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,how'd you cop early?
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Wait these are back?!?
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,4d comfortable? Compared to boost?
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Wondering how available these are going to be in the US. Confirmed app says its a queue release smh.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,How‚Äôs the fit on these?
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,How do these fit compared to UltraBoosts? Should I go half a size up or stick with the same size?
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,These are sublime!
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"Definitely go with your comfy size, or maybe even half a size up!"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,I would recommend to go half a size up in that case.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,https://sneakerpolitics.com/collections/new/products/adidas-4d-futurecraft-core-black-grey-five-linen-green
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Go get em!
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Already out in Japan and Taiwan.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"Yep, official release date for Europe and the US is 3/19 I believe."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"More bouncy and offering more stability imo. These are also lighter than the usual 4d, which is terrific."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"I find it more so, but firmer."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"They are still available in Japan and Taiwan, so I would expect that they produced these in large quantities. Sign up for the Hanon raffle, too, maybe?"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"Definitely go with your comfortable size, or even half size up!"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,If you have a proper UB 1.0 size go with that!
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,"That‚Äôs actually where I bought them this morning, but thanks!"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Full sizes??
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Thank you!
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m58pvz,Sweet thanks!
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,Go half up which should be the same as your Ultraboost sizing. Only if you have very narrow feet can you go TTS.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,"Remind me tomorrow and I‚Äôll give you my input, mine are scheduled to arrive and I ordered .5 up"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,I screwed up and ordered TTS. They were tight as shit initially but fit perfect without the insoles. I‚Äôll try throwing the insoles back in once they break in.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,How was it?
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,"What size are you?

I talked to /u/Muhsalaz and thought I'd be good going TTS. I ended up ordering TTS, then the Confirmed app restocked with a full size run, so I ordered another pair half a size up to be safe. I guess maybe I'll be returning the TTS pair."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,"Sorry thought I responded back. They fit great at tts for me, I could have even gotten away with tts but the .5 up if a comfortable fit for me"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,"I‚Äôm size 10 US. Usually a size 10 in UBs as well. My foot is a bit on the wider side especially around the ankle area and that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs the tightest on the futurecrafts. 

If you have a normal or narrow size foot you‚Äôll probably be fine TTS. If not take out the insole and test it out you might prefer that fit since you won‚Äôt have the extra space in front of your toes from going a half size up. 

If I had a chance to buy it again I would still go TTS without insole but YMMV"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,"Do you have normal feet? My TTS pair just got here and they fit surprisingly well. Lots of room in the toe, the .5 up pair might be too big on me."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,My TTS pair just got here. I'm surprised because they fit great.
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,"I‚Äôd say I have pretty flat feet so when I walk they get much wider as I step. Glad they fit you, people seem to be all over the place with sizing these"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,madt3y,Dope man!! Enjoy!
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m66j0l,"Whats the fit like on these, would you recommend TTS"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m66j0l,How do these feel compared to boost?
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m66j0l,"Definitely your comfortable size, or even half a size up! Fit tight!"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m66j0l,They offer a bit more bounce and stability compared to boost. Ymmw though!
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m66j0l,"I might look at a half up, they only did whole sizes on the first release"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m66j0l,Do they fit tight length wise or width wise?
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m66j0l,"They offer half sizes this time... These are an US11.5, my go to size for ultra boosts."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m66j0l,"I would say in general... Don't have wide feet myself, but the pk seems tighter than on Ultra Boost for instance."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,mfelm9,"FYI for anyone wondering about sizing, I got these in a US 8 and they fit well. My feet are a bit on the wide side, but these are really comfortable. 

For reference on my other shoes sizes if you're not sure. 

7 US in Stan Smiths 
8 US in Superstars 
7.5 US in AJ1s and other Nikes I've owned"
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m97msw,"There are a handful of base Ultraboost, 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 2019 2020 and now Ultraboost 2021.

If you look for discounts, you can usually find a pair of ultraboosts under retail. Regarding fashionability, the 1.0 -4.0 are generally regarded as the best looking while the newer ones are more comfortable. You can probably expect to spend ~100-150$

All the other models listed contain different materials.
Specifically the 4D which is a different type of midsole."
Futurecraft 4D 2021,m97msw,"https://www.adidas.com/us/blog/389211

""Boost"" is a term used by Adidas to describe the material. it's a material developed by another company BASF. Puma bought the tech from the same company and is making shoes with it too, but called it something different

Adidas names the shoes that use this ""Boost"" material like "".....-Boost"". so there are pureboost, solarboost, ...., ultraboost, etc

""4D"" is the name for the material that looks like it's 3D printed. so shoes with that material will have names that include ""4D"" 


not sure if ""ultra"" implies the premium line for all shoes, but for the Boost line, i think the ""ultra"" in ultraboost _is_ implying it's the premium/top of the line model (for the non-limited edition shoes i guess)


> I guess I'd like to buy a pair of the latest models, although I'm not sure if any have been released in 2021. Sorry if this has a really obvious answer, but it is a bit of a maze for me.

for ultraboost, there have been multiple releases/updates/redesign the last few years, and it actually a pretty big change compared to the 2019/2020 year, so yeah the latest model is the ""ultraboost 21"" (as in 2021) there are probably other new models out but i think ultraboost is the one that they spend the most money and effort advertising for

Reebok Club C 85,l2sapv,Nice.  My parents bought me a pair in '89 at Disney World.
Reebok Club C 85,l2sapv,Got the 85 Club C Rads for 29.99 at footlocker last year and they were one of favorite pickups all year. Don't have to cost a guap to be dope.

Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,"Being continents away, I really wish I had access to their shop to pick up a pair. These are so clean.

How‚Äôs the leather quality OP?"
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,They got real creative with this one :P
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,Wish this weren‚Äôt in store only!! So clean.
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,Never out of stock yet it‚Äôs out of stock.
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,Originals $70 in my outlet store.  These look no different.
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,Top quality tbh. Has slightly more padding then my other club c‚Äôs inside which is nice
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,I know you‚Äôre making a joke but that‚Äôs the whole point of these. To have a premium version of the original. I much prefer these over something creative like the Tom and Jerry pair for example. These are much more wearable and look better in my opinion.
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,lol
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,Resale prices arnt the worst right now
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,I rather have these for the premium materials. You ain‚Äôt a real sneaker head if you can‚Äôt see the difference. I genuinely think you‚Äôre blind and delusional if you think these are the same as pairs at the outlet.
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,"There are cheaper Club C‚Äôs, there also cheaper Jordan‚Äôs, I don‚Äôt see your point?  These were only maybe 15% more than new off the shelf Club C‚Äôs.."
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,What‚Äôs the retail on these btw?
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,"Thanks for your reply, I think it's an interesting question what makes a good collab. While I totally understand the idea and appeal behind something like this I'd still argue that the rare opportunity for a store to design their own pair of shoes should be used to come up with something more unique."
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,woah there big guy
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,This is same stuff other than patta logo
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,"For me personally I like the simplistic nature of a Club C and like it when a collab keeps that with a small stamp of brand. 

But I see your point, as someone who paid for JJJJound Club C‚Äôs I know what over paying for a ‚Äòbasic‚Äô sneaker feels like..just had to have the name on there ha!"
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,Eh Patta does really good work on their collabs. These aren‚Äôt meant to be exclusive as they‚Äôre considered always in stock at Patta stores. So these would be considered like the supreme AF1s which are pretty basic.
Reebok Club C 85,k7ttsz,"I mean if they're not limited and always available then it's kind of a different story, obviously Patra usually have great collabs tho. I wouldn't exactly call those Supreme AF1s a good collab either tho."

Retrobok called the Revenge [‚Äúa Club C with sidestripes.‚Äù](https://retrobok.com/tag/reebok-revenge/) Reebok tends to use the Revenge when they want to get adventurous with colorways and alternate soles. The Club C options have, for the most part, remained pretty consistent."

Reebok Club C 85,6rmved,"TBH they look like dad shoes, but really cool dad shoes."
Reebok Club C 85,6rmved,Not if your taking a sht
Reebok Club C 85,6rmved,so much love
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,where did you buy these?
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,They sold out instantly on their website üò≠
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"The club c is one of the most underrated sneakers of all time. Comfortable, clean design, looks good in basically any colorway, fits tts, and as a side note.... Doubles oddly enough as a fantastic (albeit not in the longevity dept so much) skate shoe."
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"just got mine in this week too and i‚Äôm in love with em. not gonna lie, swapping out the laces for the cream ones rly made me love em even more! my only complaint is that they run a little tight in the toes, although the length is perfect. first pair of club c‚Äôs, or reebok‚Äôs even, that i‚Äôve owned so i figured i‚Äôd go TTS"
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"Bro these are crazy, love the geobaskets in the background too"
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"Hey man, these are clean.  Mind x-posting to r/reebok?"
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,Thinking about buying them. Is the upper white or cream color?
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,Material usage on these is INSANE
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"Damn, these are lovely"
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,I got these off of stock x a lil bit after the restock the original release was a pop up in Montreal then a global release on JJJJOUND website
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,I did eat up an L on the release but in stock x after the restock they went down to like 190 and are even less they're definitely worth it for that price I wasn't gonna get them for like $600-$800 after the very first pop up release like the first few pairs on grailed but for $200 or so they're really nice
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,Honestly I had to flex but also I just really like the lighting from this spot in my room too haha
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"Thank you :) sure, I didn't know r/Reebok existed, nice, also I would have loved if it was r/eebok"
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"The lighting in my room casts a very warm color, the leather on these is about as white as leather can get. (not a true white like a mesh or canvas shoe would be but pretty white, think common projects achilles)

Edit: I've been looking at them in a more natural neutral light and I would say the upper is a slightly green of blue tinged white, the tongue is a considerably red tinted cream, almost bordering on a very light pink. The sole is a true white, the cream detail on the quarter and heel is yellow tinted, like what most would consider a true eggshell or cream. Interestingly, if you consider the upper blue tinted, that covers all three primary colors, which might explain a design that many people have considered to be ""under designed"""
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"They are so understated, the colors are just barely different enough to warrant, the material choice is great, easily already one of my favorite choices for summer, up there with my favorite Reebok's"
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"ah i see, first time seeing them. so clean üëå"
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"Almost $300 in my size, RIP. Small feet suck"
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,Shit. r/eebok was a totally missed opportunity.
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,I gotta agree 100%
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"They're crazy clean, I have the SNS 'premium' club c 85s too and they're super comfy, I really like the Terry cloth lining on these, the nice fabric tongue, they're just the perfect example of ""less is more"""
Reebok Club C 85,bz4kah,"Oof, I would be hesistant to say that's worth it for $100 more"
Reebok Club C 85,dxsdbz,"Love my Killshots, really comfortable. That would be my pick."
Reebok Club C 85,dxsdbz,Blue or green swoosh?
Reebok Club C 85,dxsdbz,"Blue for me. Green looks good too, but I‚Äôm more of a blue guy"
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,"Man, the Vintage Reebok releases are such a nice bang for your buck. The quality on 'em is crazy for under $100."
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Underrated
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,It is boktober after all! 
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,"Nice, def got vintage vibes"
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Id on the pants?
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Did you get these on the Reebok site? I'm having difficulty finding the cream (Paperwhite) colourway in men's here in Canada.
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,classic. much better than achilles low imo
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,I think they sold those at Beals when I worked there as a sophomore in HS. 
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,the kinda quality you should be getting all day errday 
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Looking like h&m zipper pants in green. Could be wrong tho.
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Jack & Jones Trend Joggers in Olive Night
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,I got mine from Size? UK. Recently in Germany they restocked these but in green. Don‚Äôt know about Canada tho.
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Check out urban outfitters they‚Äôre on sale for $50. Not sure if it‚Äôs everywhere but I saw them in Downtown Toronto and there were lots of sizes left.
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Thanks man 
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Where did they restock in Germany?
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,The ones in the pic btw
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,"I'll go have a peek, thanks!"
Reebok Club C 85,9o1pg3,Asphaltgold and Reebok.de
Reebok Club C 85,eebuaq,not sure if u got some yet but def don‚Äôt go down they‚Äôre a really narrow shoe. i got some tts and my pinky toes made a visible bump on the side because of how snug they were and i have pretty skinny/regular feet. ended up selling them and getting a half size up and they‚Äôre way more comfy. also side note the european size is actually half a size smaller so like a size 12 is usually a 46 but in these 12=45.5
Reebok Club C 85,cs886x,"That sounds about right, just bear in mind that the C‚Äôs are a bit narrower throughout. I‚Äôm a 9.5 in Jordan‚Äôs, 9 in Converse, 42 in Common Projects and a 9 in these was tight but broke in to be fairly comfortable. If I was doing it again I might get a 9.5 honestly."
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,"Clean retro style, even if they don't get much love."
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,How comfortable are they? Thinking of picking some up to skate in.
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,I just got the white pair I love mine.
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,Oh man let those babies breathe. They look nice with the laces loose. That's how I rock mine. 
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,True to size?
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,The leather on these ESTL‚Äôs are super nice. Good pick up. 
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,Totally agree. 
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,It takes them a couple of wears to break in. They are a little stiff. But they get comfortable 
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,I got the white one first. I loved them. Got this. 
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,Yeah just breaking them in. My other pair is laced loose only. 
Reebok Club C 85,9227gp,Yes. They feel a little snug to start with. You'll initially feel that you should have gone 0.5 size up. But they open up in 1-2 wears. 
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Love these things so much. Great summer beater
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Those are some nice Yeezy Calabasas Powerphases you got there. 
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,"These have been my secret weapon for ever! If you like em check out the Club Memt with gum sole, just a little more low profile, clean as hell, have lasted longer than the normal club c so far!"
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,"Should I go TTS on these?
"
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,[deleted]
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Can't wait to get my pair. Honestly my most confident shoe purchase ever and I'm stoked.
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Reebok classics are the new vans. 
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,"I just copped the red suede version. Wore them once, got more compliments than almost any other shoe I own - would totally pick up the white if I didn't just grab new stan smiths on sale. Enjoy"
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,The poor man's Yeezy Powerphase
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,For $34 can't argue. Might cop a 2nd pair when the ones I get start to die.
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Agree üëçüèª
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Haha! Good one
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,He always rips others off so it's nothing new for him. The Reebok's beat him by 30+ years though. 
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,They are a little narrow in the toe box for me.  I bought same size as my ultra boost core 1.0
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,"Got these in white, narrow like op said but TTS for me"
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Hey man- they are a off white / ivory color.  Exact reason why i bought these.  Something diff
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,[deleted]
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Where'd you get em for $34
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,But the powerphases were originally released in the 1980s...
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,[deleted]
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Finishline
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Finishline
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,"So was the Club C. 1984 or 85, IIRC. "
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Yes there is - its on sale at finishline for less than $40 i think
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,"Dope thanks a lot, you get the same color?  I'm thinkin bout goin for the navy one"
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,What... The Yeezy Powerphases arent a rip off. Theyre just Powerphases.
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Yea I got the white ones. After trying to dress a little nicer I read up that a white pair of leather shoes is a must have for all guys thus leading me to purchase these.
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,Which is a rip off of he Club C. Ironic though since Adidas owns Reebok. 
Reebok Club C 85,6hxo4i,"> He always rips others off so it's nothing new for him.

So then it's not Kanye that ripped Reebok off but Adidas 30 years ago? I'm not a Kanye stan but let's not unfairly say shit like that.

Also, I don't think you know what ironic means. "
Reebok Club C 85,8zurmv,This is a great shoe. I prefer these over stan smith‚Äôs since literally everyone wear stans.
Reebok Club C 85,8zurmv,"pants look very oversized like damn

i like the look tho, props"
Reebok Club C 85,8zurmv,!bootcutbandit
Reebok Club C 85,8zurmv,I find the Stan's fit a little weird on my fit. Not the most comfortable. Hence these are a perfect option. I got the iniki runner in white. But chose these over them. 
Reebok Club C 85,8zurmv,[this is how they fall though. Maybe the first picture was a very bad angle](http://imgur.com/Xy7vNN1.jpg)

Reebok Club C 85,8zurmv,Yeah the jeans are getting too much hate. I guess now I know what angles to avoid. Thanks ‚úåüèæ
Reebok Club C 85,9qx40j,Club C‚Äôs have to be one of the best reasonably priced sneakers around 
Reebok Club C 85,9qx40j,Reebok as a whole seems kinda slept on
Reebok Club C 85,9qx40j,These are interesting!
Reebok Club C 85,9qx40j,"[On feet and more photos](https://imgur.com/a/4n6YRIc)

Weird these didn't get more attention. 0 Youtube videos and no posts that I could find on Reddit. BAIT just opened up a store here in Hawaii and I found these, their Ex-O-Fits, and Workouts all sitting. Given, there are really minor things changed such as the labeling/flags and insoles, but I love em."
Reebok Club C 85,6ynlti,"Club C 85 is such an underrated shoe IMO, if they made a premium leather version of these i would be so hyped"
Reebok Club C 85,6ynlti,[deleted]
Reebok Club C 85,6ynlti,My review of these: http://www.allaboutanthony.com/reebok-club-c-85-elm-review/
Reebok Club C 85,6ynlti,Noiiiiiice!
Reebok Club C 85,6ynlti,"hey watched your video. How are the shoes holding up ? I've found that the buttery soft leather ended up getting very worn/creased/dirty very quickly. Do you have further thoughts on the material/ model/ maintenance? 

I had a similar pair ( i just put up a post about them - https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/7rv9cp/reebok_club_c_85_seem_to_age_faster_than_most/)"
Reebok Club C 85,6ynlti,Thanks for watching!  I haven‚Äôt worn them enough to wear them down that much.  They still look pretty good.  The pair in your link look pretty thrashed (no offense) - were you wearing them daily?
Reebok Club C 85,6ynlti,"yeah definitely wore them a lot, guess that's its lifespan. 

I thought that nice leather would = more durable, but seems not in this case?"
Reebok Club C 85,6ynlti,Yea super soft leather can = trashed ASAP if it‚Äôs a light colorway.  Better to take care of your kicks and choose a darker pair with a tougher exterior for beaters
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,Nah you just beat the hell out of them without any maintenance.
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,how old are they? 
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,I think they would look better if you wiped them down
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,"Hm, if you don't like them because they're not made great, i've had the SNS club c 85s and they've held up real nice, got pics up of them, maybe get them the leather is great and hasn't torn or separated from the sole on me but also I keep them fairly clean"
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,I think that C 85's and white sneakers in general look a lot better when they're beat up. When mine were new it gave me the 'dentist shoe' vibe.
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,"mine got beat to hell super quick too. especially in the stitching, a lot harder to clean than just wiping down leather"
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,Can I get some sizing advice on these ? 
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,What kind of maintenance would you suggest?  I have not been particularly careful with them (other types of shoes I've had have held up) but could be a bit more aware in the future. 
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,"A year. The leather's very soft, they were quickly getting creased/wrinkled and dirt gets pretty soaked in. 

Wondering if it's just to be expected for whiter sneakers and/or this style, if anyone else has experience with them. I really liked them but didn't last long.

The material also started tearing in two places. I don't know if they're particularly badly made for some reason, I thought Reeboks would have been fairly reliable. "
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,"Yeah, I'll try some things. I'm just worried about the soft texture of the leather it seems the dirt is not on the surface but it would get more embedded/sink deeper. Thanks"
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,How do you clean /maintain them? Thanks for the tips
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,"Yeah they look better when they are dirty. Not too much, but a little. Same with Vans."
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,tts
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,I just wipe dirt off the uppers within a day or two before it dries out the leather and not wear them if I'm gonna be outside on dirt a lot
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,Thanks friend ; also i would give anything to have my shoes look like this- i love the destroyed worn in look 
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp," lol [this](https://imgur.com/wmAHl7u) is where mine are, after a particularly intense concert last week. but like fuck, i can't wear these to work. i wiped down the leather but the stitching is just black now. time to get another pair, ha"
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,Damn those look amazing; did you TTS as well? 
Reebok Club C 85,7rv9cp,"yep, went with my usual adidas size"

and did you have to pay any extra duty fees?"
Reebok Club C 85,77onfz,One more question: TTS or .5 up?
Reebok Club C 85,77onfz,"They‚Äôre so tempting, awesome pickup dude. How does the leather feel, along with the comfort level?"
Reebok Club C 85,77onfz,The leather is fantastic - if you‚Äôre on the fence I‚Äôd pull the trigger. Very comfortable as well
Reebok Club C 85,77onfz,"damn I want a pair of these to just fuck up like none other 

I might just go with a pair of workout plus vintage for $70 instead of these for $160+ lol "
Reebok Club C 85,77onfz,"I‚Äôm terrible at taking on foot pics so no luck there - sorry! But I‚Äôve never had to pay duty fees when ordering from SNS, and I‚Äôve ordered several times."

Reebok Club C 85,88nhmy,I love 'em but missed my chance. :(
Reebok Club C 85,88nhmy,The quality on these is something else. Wish I got myself a pair. 
Reebok Club C 85,88nhmy,Club C's always look clean!
Reebok Club C 85,88nhmy,i believe there‚Äôs like 3 left on the sneakersnstuff website last time i check...
Reebok Club C 85,88nhmy,there‚Äôs acouple left on the sneakersnstuff website i believe... 
Reebok Club C 85,88nhmy,"Yeah but not in my size, I look around for them every few weeks."
Reebok Club C 85,939ua9,i‚Äôm trying to decide if i should go up a half size in these what do y‚Äôall think? the side of my toe touches where i‚Äôm pointing and after i wear them awhile (like maybe after a day of wearing) they can start to be uncomfy but i hear reebok‚Äôs are just on the narrower side so idk. the length is fine tho my big toe ends right where the stitching on the toe box starts. thanks for any tips!
Reebok Club C 85,939ua9,I went TTS with mine
Reebok Club C 85,939ua9,"With the clubs it‚Äôs TTS , at least for me it is:)"
Reebok Club C 85,939ua9,how‚Äôs the fit in the toe area? like i can wiggle my toes an everything they just seem a tad narrow on the sides right before my toes
Reebok Club C 85,939ua9,does ur pinky toe rub on the side? mine does but it doesn‚Äôt really hurt. just wondering if this is normal
Reebok Club C 85,939ua9,Def narrow. I think the Club C just fits like that though. The Classic Leathers are much more wide foot friendly
Reebok Club C 85,939ua9,"theyre on sale rn for 50 dollars here but its only available on a size 8, im a size 9 on my vans slip ons but im a 8.5 on my adidas adi-ease. Would they fit? I dont really want the small feet look."
Reebok Club C 85,939ua9,"Ehh idk, your toes will definitely be constricted by sizing down. I'd personally just skip the sale and get the size that fits you, they're not that expensive anyway"
Reebok Club C 85,8vi33j,The only shoe that‚Äôs relevant forever. Club . It‚Äôs such sleek sneaker

Reebok Club C 85,7dc8og,"wore mine doing errands today and its easily my fave C 85 out of em all. super comfy, TTS fit and the minimal golden branding"
Reebok Club C 85,7dc8og,These are BDG overalls from Urban Outfitters. I have a longer torso than average so i got a size up from 30 to 32 in the waist so they fit a little bit looser but i assume if you're normally proportioned they fit true to size. 
Reebok Club C 85,7dc8og,"Very true! I'll post up a more detailed picture of them soon, they're a beautiful shoe with really nice craftsmanship"
Reebok Club C 85,98j8ul,I have the Club C 85 in Grey and White. Have the Continental 80 in Off White. The Reebok's get more rotation. I like the Reebok better.
Reebok Club C 85,98j8ul,"on the style point, imo Continentals are better looking, mostly cause they are similar to Calab

but dont own any so cant help you with comfort"
Reebok Club C 85,86u06p,Super clean! 
Reebok Club C 85,86u06p,Thanks man surprisingly comfy too
Reebok Club C 85,60pib7,Andretti OG üî•
Reebok Club C 85,60pib7,"Hot damn, the outer layer has got a mesmerizing texture!"
Reebok Club C 85,60pib7,damn where did you cop? I wanna support my man spitta
Reebok Club C 85,60pib7,weed inspired haha. it's super soft to the touch
Reebok Club C 85,60pib7,Jimmy Jazz 
Reebok Club C 85,60pib7,I'm guessing those are hemp laces? I bet they look dope
Reebok Club C 85,60pib7,yeah the green ones do them no justice. definitely putting the hemp laces in soon. 
Reebok Club C 85,97kx8x,"Someone ask me about this shoe, in my opinion they're hotter than Continental 80 or the Calabasas, which Adidas knocked off in the 80s when Reebok was dominating the market."
Reebok Club C 85,66iqfq,Are these still available anywhere? Huge Curren$y fan and I've never even seen these before. 
Reebok Club C 85,66iqfq,I'm not sure tbh. I caught them on a restock on jimmy jazz. 
Reebok Club C 85,66iqfq,Try goat 
Reebok Club C 85,66iqfq,How long ago?
Reebok Club C 85,66iqfq,Almost a month 
Reebok Club C 85,6rhway,"I just got my in the mail, I'll tell you how it feels after work but I ordered tts. I hope it fits nicely 
Edit: they fit nice for me tts"
Reebok Club C 85,6rhway,I wear 6.5 GS for jordan 1s and I got these in a 6 GS. 
Reebok Club C 85,6rhway,Do they fit good?
Reebok Club C 85,6rhway,Yup - perfect fit with a tiny amount of room in the toe box. 
Reebok Club C 85,8ors92,Go with whatever you like more my dude! Personally i dig the Club C 85 silhouette though.
Reebok Club C 85,8ors92,"Yeah, I like the c85 more too but some reviews say that they're quite bulky and use poor quality leather. I am also not quite sure if they go with everything. Have you had a pait and if so how has you experience been?"
Reebok Club C 85,7mapvv,I really liked the gray CW of this shoes. Always a classic. Nice pickup
Reebok Club C 85,5zwuu2,Best dressed in attendance and I never left the house curren$y is a G
Reebok Club C 85,5zwuu2,Those pants are hungry 
Reebok Club C 85,44lgoy,"Reebok has several court tennis on their website, that said I'm ordering a pair for me still have to decide either green or blue"
Reebok Club C 85,44lgoy,"Stan Smiths, Nike Tennis Classics?"
Reebok Club C 85,msqwzs,Classic.
Reebok Club C 85,msqwzs,This was my first pair of reebok‚Äôs as well. Next pair is gonna have to be a pair of reebok classic legacy‚Äôs
Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,Decembok
Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,Definitively a big fan of club c‚Äôs
Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,Im about to buy the Hot Ones collab! Any advise on the sizing would be greatly appreciated.
Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,I actually like reeboks. Im fan of instapumps and workout plus
Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,"I really love the Reebok classic leather, and would love a pair of club c sometime!"
Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,I‚Äôve been liking these and the zig kinetica.
Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,The only Reeboks I own are pump fury's. Probably going to be the only reebok's I own.
Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,Reecember

Reebok Club C 85,kasd9t,bok boys in da house üë®üèº‚Äçü¶±üë©üèø‚Äçü¶±üë∂üèª
Reebok Club C 85,m3a209,"Between those two, the Club C‚Äôs no question. So much more versatility for everyday wear (school, shopping, going to bags, games, etc) The NB is very much a ‚Äúsneaker‚Äù that is more sporty than casual if that makes sense."
Reebok Club C 85,m3a209,"Club C! My beaters are Reebok classic leathers, and I love them. Super comfy and look great beat. Club C seem to be the same, seen a lot of great looking beat pairs."
Reebok Club C 85,i6ggrs,"The tan nappy suede and pink sock liner compliment each other really well, both super dope pairs!"
Reebok Club C 85,i6ggrs,"I'm waiting on the grey club c to be delivered, I love the brown too. Such a clean shoe"
Reebok Club C 85,i6ggrs,The brown pair for sure!
NMD CS2,h071gd,Recently managed to cop this personal grail. Something I‚Äôve been eyeing besides the usual hyped sneakers. Thanks for the upvotes. Still new to reddit. Lots of love my sneakerheads! ‚ô•Ô∏èüî•
NMD CS2,h071gd,Love these. I ended up getting the tan and pink ones when they came down in price. Make no mistake: the  pinks are üî•!
NMD CS2,h071gd,"the nmd r2 and cs2 are so slept on, i think they look SO good. these are üî•"
NMD CS2,h071gd,Thanks g üî•üôèüèª
NMD CS2,h071gd,"I found these same ones at a buffalo exchange for $24, easily the fastest i have ever grabbed something in my life. these are beyond comfy"
NMD CS2,h071gd,Got them at a much lower price to for DS üî•üî•üî•
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,probably the nicest NMD I‚Äôve seen since the hype died down. Cool find!
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Thia is just a custom right?
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,"Damn that‚Äôs ~~hot~~ wet, would cop if it was real"
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Saw this online and thought it was worth sharing ! üåä
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,I would buy these in a heartbeat 
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,"It's a concept made by ARGO\_CONCEPTS iirc

still a nice design tho, wish it would release like that ngl"
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,"Damn dude, that's so wavyüåäüåäüåä
(I'm not sorry for this)"
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Want!
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Beautiful more like art than a shoe. 
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Are those real? So cool
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Wish this was real üò¢
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,These are fantastic.
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,IIIIIIIIII NEEEEDDDDDD ITTTTTTTT
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,i normally don‚Äôt like the city socks mainly because i prefer the stlt pk over any others but these are making me change my mind
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,"This is such a sick shoe, I wonder the likelyhood adidas would be able to do them. I'd cop in a heartbeat"
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,"Have a pair of these CS2's sitting in my closer for years now, this would be a nice custom to do."
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,These are fire would definitely buy if they were on the R1's
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Omg that‚Äôs amazing 
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,So sexy
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,I was going to make a pair of pumas like this
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,These are beautifully done.
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,wow
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,my hair is still wavyer
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,you guys have awful taste jesus fuckin christ. put this wave on any shoe and every comment is ‚Äúbruh these is fire üî•üî•üî•‚Äù
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,If I could do a Nike ID like this...
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Kind of surprised CS2s never blew up. They were one of the nicest looking NMDs imo. 
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Yea I assume so. 
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,Yeah you can see that the model was a naked x kith cs2 sandstone
NMD CS2,b7m2mr,"I‚Äòm new to this whole Sneaker thing, would you care to elaborate?

Does custom mean you just send some sort of jpg and they print that stuff on a shoe of your choice for a 300% premium or are they truly one-off where the artist ‚Äûdraws‚Äú on them? 

And if the latter, why ‚Äûjust a custom‚Äú? I‚Äòm confused üòÅ"
NMD CS2,dn3khi,Balenciaga speed trainers hahaha
NMD CS2,dn3khi,"I like the primeknit and how the shoes look from the angle in the picture, but I'm not really digging the red on the other side."

NMD CS2,gnkj6h,"I'm a 10 in UBs, I also have a 10 in CS2s, fits great."
NMD CS2,gnkj6h,How do they each fit? I just got a pair of R1s in and they fit a bit looser than my UBs
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,"Nice man, mine are arriving tomorrow. First sneakers with any boost material, or from Adidas in general for me. Struggled between these and Ultraboost 4.0 but these were on sale so opted for them. How are they comfort wise?"
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,"Have the same pair. Can confirm, are dope."
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,Dope
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,my friend has these and omg they look so good
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,I love the silhouette but I'm still waiting for the right colorway. Wish there were more options.
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,OG NMD vibes üôèüôè
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,"Just got these too! First pair of CS2s and I'm really happy with them. Was really tempted to get the triple black CS2s but I couldn't turn down the ‚Ç¨80 discount on these, plus I think the white boost and splash of meta-reference red and blue will make them nicer for summer. "
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,Whats the sizing on these?
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,They are the most comfortable shoes I own
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,What‚Äôre you hoping for?
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,8.5
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,Then you didn‚Äòt try other comfy shoes. 
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,"I'd most prefer a super simple colorway like what they have on the CS1s, like a black/white/white or a white/white/gum. They've also had a handful of colors I like but I don't like the patterns.

That or just something that isn't so... Bright. I lean towards slightly dark, warm, muted tones- navy, burgundy, mustard, olive- rather than the bright colors they tend to use on the CS2s."
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,Oh i meant like are they true to size or do you need to go half a size down?
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,"Yeah, the only ones I can think of would be the new triple black or the class of 99 burgundy. I hope they release something that you dig!"
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,The black white dark gray combo has arrived! 
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,Oh true to size
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,Link? Would love to see
NMD CS2,8hz3ae,[NMD CS2](https://m.adidas.com/us/nmd_cs2-primeknit-shoes/D96744.html) 
NMD CS2,7qcax6,How is the sizing on these? Full size down?
NMD CS2,7qcax6,"Good stuff man, I have the same pair and they pop."
NMD CS2,7qcax6,"I went half up and they fit a bit loose but with a thick pair of socks they fit perfectly, I‚Äôd suggest going tts."
NMD CS2,7qcax6,"They really do, A pair of black jeans work so well with them, How do you wear your pair?"
NMD CS2,7qcax6,"I do the same thing! They work ok with some pinrolled khakis, but I found black jeans with a neutral shirt is the way to go to bring out the color of the shoes."
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,"They have an OG NMD vibe to them with the red and blue.

I love it"
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,these arent a collab or anything but they stupid clean
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,holy fuck
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,When do these release? I‚Äôve been waiting for an OG R2/CS2 
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,Man these are clean ! And I hate CS2s 
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,This is the first CS2 I‚Äôve actually liked. Any more info?
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,Damn these are nice! One of my favs
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,these are clean AF!
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,Yup these are pretty dope. Still a GR colorway but it's one of the only cs2's I've liked so far 
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,December 22
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,Shock Pink are my fav pair but damn these are giving them a run for their money. Might have to cop these
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,"i love cs2s, but no cw has ever convinced me enough to get a pair except for these. gonna have to wait and pray these don't sell out. i've already spent too much this holiday season."
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,If I wasn't holding out for the ua and sons colab these would be a must cop.
NMD CS2,7jf0ry,"The boost on these one's look different from the others? Might be the angle but they look good af, like shock pink more tho"

NMD CS2,7jf0ry,CS2 and R2 have scale boost (looks like fish scales) instead of the normal pellet boost

NMD CS2,7jf0ry,"heres a thought people like what they like not everyone has to be on the same train, just bc something doesn't have hype or loses hype doesn't mean its played out, everyone has their own taste, in the words of Lavar Ball stay in yo lane bruh

and thats with the fact that I don't like any of the r2 or cs2, I feel like the blocks give the shoe the extra touch they need"

NMD CS2,5xx5cb,i gotta have those jedi tunic for my feet!
NMD CS2,5xx5cb,CS2 looks so much better than the previous one
NMD CS2,5xx5cb,"I like this, but I gotta see a top down pic before committing to it. The navy samples that have been floating around looked dope from this angle, but when you see it from the top down, you see that ugly line pattern forming a circle which looks silly on feet. "
NMD CS2,5xx5cb,Thems are flames
NMD CS2,5xx5cb,These are fire. The pink ones not so much imo
NMD CS2,5xx5cb,These are super clean. Loving the CS2 the more colorways I see.
NMD CS2,5xx5cb,Gah the blue shit kinda kills it for me
NMD CS2,5xx5cb,Just make sure to clean up after yourself.

cs2's looking like a super fine summer shoe tbh"
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,Wow those are extremely clean.
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,Are these true to size?
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,How much does such minimalism cost? And does it come in black or white?
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,Cop from sns?

NMD CS2,8lk0z6,Thank you!!
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"Well that‚Äôs a steal then, I‚Äôd get the black one, looks good with semi-casual attire as well.

EDIT: oh, only green is fully discounted."
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"Sites like ENDclothing have sales pretty often, i've seen different colors of these go for around 100"
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,Wonder if they ship outside the US though.
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"END is a UK based company and SneakersnStuff are based in Sweden, i've ordered from both and live in the Netherlands. 

SNS kinda fucked me over recently though, ordered a shirt and a mug on sale for very cheap and shipping is 10$. 

Order was processing for 1,5 weeks and then the shirt was out of stock apparantly so only the shirt price got refunded. I'm stuck paying 10$ shipping on a 13$ mug and I couldn't cancel the order anymore because they shipped it right after sending me the message that the shirt was out of stock..

 

When I got the Off-White Jordan 1's from them they shipped fast and without any issue however."
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"Ah great, time to check their stuff, right now I have no need as I just got a black with grey sole Free RN flyknit for $30, perhaps if I find pharells for a nice price I‚Äôd think about it.

Thanks anyways for the info and the effort put on it buddy, saved your comment."
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"Ah I got a pair of the multicolor Free RN flyknits at the outlet for 58‚Ç¨ , solid pair of sneakers. 

The pharell tennis hu's go on sale every once in a while, the NMD's are too hyped though."
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"The Free RN flyknit are my favorite sneakers so far, even more so than Ultraboost Primeknit, mainly due to the Free having wider room on the front for my wide feet.

Love the pharrell NMD look to be honest, the chinese characters look lovely, they‚Äôre expensive I believe?"
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"I think the newer ones have hindu characters but yeah they retail at 200 something and don't go on sale, very much a pair people will line up for at stores. "
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"Ah I see.

Perhaps I‚Äôd just save more and get a Balenciaga, those worth the price I believe.

For now I‚Äôll just stick with my flyknit and save more for one proper sneaker mentioned above."
NMD CS2,8lk0z6,"I'd say look around a bit on the sales sites, there's some good stuff to find but you gotta get lucky if you have a common size. 

If you want good quality for how much you're paying Asics Gel Lyte 3 or 5's are very comfy and fairly cheap because they're not as hyped. Some of them go for 50-100 on sale at END. "

NMD CS2,7n01ha,Solid pickup. Only CS2s that look better IMO are the UA and Sons Adidas accidentally dropped then cancelled all the orders for a few weeks ago.
NMD CS2,7n01ha,Honestly.. my ronins are so uncomfortable..first and last of this shoe
NMD CS2,7n01ha,does your heel constantly touch the heel cup of the shoe?
NMD CS2,7n01ha,The best CS2 colorway I've ever seen. 
NMD CS2,7n01ha,"yeah, extremely satisfied with these. haven't seen the ua and son's colorway until you mentioned it, but those look crazy good."
NMD CS2,7n01ha,Do you mean the brick? I have wide feet so I instantly felt the brick when I put the shoe on which I why I don't have any CS2s. Some people say they don't mind/feel it but it was pretty bad for me
NMD CS2,7n01ha,I don't have any CS2 but it's the same brick as R2s and I agree the brick is pretty bad for me
NMD CS2,7x1aaj,Man they look comfy üò≠üí™
NMD CS2,7x1aaj,Just copped pair last week for a similar price. 
NMD CS2,7x1aaj,Very nice! Did you get these with the 40% Adidas glitch?
NMD CS2,7x1aaj,They look DOPE!
NMD CS2,7x1aaj,"copped mine for 86$ from stockx, just couldnt say no with that 20$ code they gave me for signing up"
NMD CS2,7x1aaj,Sorry for the weeks late reply haha but they are SUPER COMFY! 
NMD CS2,7x1aaj,Nope! I got it from End Clothing 
NMD CS2,7x1aaj,I still get heated when that 40% glitch gets brought up browsing youtube screwed me again.
NMD CS2,4jek1a,Expect to see these drop Smarch 2018.
NMD CS2,4jek1a,Totally in love with these
NMD CS2,4jek1a,ninja
NMD CS2,4jek1a,looks like the boost is slightly different 
NMD CS2,4jek1a,Have the CS1s even released in the US yet?
NMD CS2,4jek1a,"Thanks, L-ed

In all seriousness, I dig these..the silhouette is sleek.
It's meant to be low profile and comfy, like it suggests, its a 'sock' "
NMD CS2,4jek1a,The look too plain

NMD CS2,4jek1a,[deleted]
NMD CS2,4jek1a,"Terrible choice, I hear Smarch has lousy weather"
NMD CS2,4jek1a,It'd be cool if the boost has the squishy feel.  
NMD CS2,4jek1a,I thought the same thing until I saw them on foot. They look pretty cool
NMD CS2,4jek1a,Hypebeast article - apparently we have a while to wait. http://hypebeast.com/2016/5/first-look-adidas-originals-nmd-cs2?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=facebook_post

NMD CS2,6cgpsd,Ninja Vibesüëª
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,This pic really does the shoes justice.
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,I didn't like these at first but I'm changing my mind the more I see them. Look great
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"Fuck these are fire, slept on af in my opinion"
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,holy shit they nice 
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,Shinobi kicks.
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"These are fire but in the other hand so hard to style
Seems like black socks and black pants are the only choice to match"
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,These look great. If the ribbing wasn't white I would've copped.
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"I don't really like them, but I can see why people would. The no-laces thing just doesn't do it for me."
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,i'm kinda glad they're not too hyped tbh. I'd hate for Kanye to wear a pair and see 100s of people in the street walking in em lol
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"That's one of the things I like, I think it just adds to the minimalist look"
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"Yep lol, me too. I'll pick up a pair but I'm gonna sleep on them for now. How's the sizing? TTS or .5 down?"
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"Said the same thing the other day lol, Ive got some ronins and ogs, working on getting some more of the CS 1's but will prob cop these at some point."
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,Yea these grew on me too. I think it's how sleek they look. City ninjas haha.
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,They're TTS - I also get why people tell people with 'fat feet' to watch out too bcos they're pretty tight and snug in the middle. 
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"The only CS2 I have is the Kith, and I went .5 down (I'm a TTS 10.5). My buddy is getting 2 pairs of 10.5 so I might ask him to let me cop a pair for retail. Ty bro!"
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,You're welcome bruh üôå
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"I'm considering buying Kith CS2 resale...go down .5 is your recommendation?
"
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,Yep! I'm a TTS 10.5 and I got a 10 and it fits perfectly 
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"I have CS1 all black and I went have a size down and they fit snug as a bug, I was nervous cause I have wide feet but they are perfect with some extra room. "
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,Thanks! So frustrating that CS2 have different fits. It's similar to getting my Parley UB TTS and they're a little snug unlike the other UB 3.0 colorways. 
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"Yep, me too. I got the CS1 .5 size down and it fits perfectly. I thought Kith CS2 was the same but upon hearing these other CS2 models being TTS, I'm a little nervous. 

Any confirmation on Kith CS2?"
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"Yeah, Adidas sizing is screwed up. I swear every shoe has a different size, it's annoying. Glad to help though! "
NMD CS2,6cgpsd,"I took a L on those so I wouldn't be sure, sorry about that man"
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"TIL that boost floats, pretty logical tbh but I never thought about it"
NMD CS2,6enqdc,Do you think the chemicals in the pool would cause yellowing ?
NMD CS2,6enqdc,Wonder what all those people were thinking watching someone put their shoes in the pool and taking a picture lol. 
NMD CS2,6enqdc,What's with all the x's
NMD CS2,6enqdc,Pretty cool. Would be godly if you were wearing them and floating on the water üòá
NMD CS2,6enqdc,These. Tbh id probably sell my soul. Wish there were more colors but still 
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"Anything that is overall less dense than water will float on water because the water that it displaces is heavier and therefor it can't ""lift"" the water around itself. BASF advertises Infinergy, the polymer behind boost, as having a density of 265 kg/m3. This makes it almost 4 times less dense than water (1000 kg/m3)"
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"All shoes float, just a fun fact :) I think i said the same thing on a post similar to this, dunno if its the same guy though."
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"Not all boost shoes float tho, at least not upright. My parley ultra boosts wouldn't float."
NMD CS2,6enqdc,Were you planning on going inside the pool with them or what
NMD CS2,6enqdc,That part that part that part that part Q
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"Everyone at the pool party was like wtf r u guys doing? My friends and i were like, we gotta take a dope pic of our shoes."
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"The 'x' basically signifies a collaboration between companies when it comes to shoes/clothes. So there are two x's because kith, adidas and naked all collaborated on this shoe "
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"That would be sick, but sadly no"
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"Not all shoes, but a good amount"
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"Wait really? Lmaooooo

The shoes that are made from plastic that is floating on the ocean, don't float?"
NMD CS2,6enqdc,Wanted to take a pic of mine floating in my pool that's all 
NMD CS2,6enqdc,I think it would take much longer than just a few minutes for a photo to do any damage
NMD CS2,6enqdc,Ah makes sense. Yeah I'd say they would yellow. No prticular reason I just think that the salts / chlorine there would yellow it very quickly
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"Nah, the chemicals didn't do anything to the boost on my shoes. Just place them in gently and slowly."
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"This is the most unscientific thing I've read in weeks, and I've been keeping up with American politics. "
NMD CS2,6enqdc,"I was about to downvote you for being mean, but the second half of the sentence got me"

NMD CS2,anrk4s,Sorry i meant cs2. But i have both and tts is best.
NMD CS2,ap6fks,"Without photos of how they look on foot, it's really hard to tell what the problem is."
NMD CS2,ap6fks,Redo the laces and don't tighten them. You can prolly wear them with tying them
NMD CS2,ap6fks,"https://imgur.com/a/mFAg0WB

Here's some photos. Just a quick few snaps."
NMD CS2,ap6fks,CS2s dont have laces
NMD CS2,ap6fks,Your foot clearly is wider than the sole and because of the stretchy primeknit you dont have enough support on the outside. So you are stepping on the edge which means your foot is being stressed.
NMD CS2,ap6fks,True
NMD CS2,ap6fks,"Yep thought as much. Anything I can do to make it work and alleviate the pressure like insoles or is it just a lost cause and wait for some UBs to come on sale? 

Thanks!"
NMD CS2,ap6fks,"It's really hard to tell. You should go to a store and ask for some insoles or something. And then try on a few different models and sizes to find the right shoe. Dont force yourself into shoes that arent comfortable. Go a size up if needed, even is you may have a little room in the front then. There's no point in wearing a shoe that's not comfortable to you."
NMD CS2,7qz6lu,Sounds like you do a decent amount of walking that being the case 100% go with the Ultra Boost 
NMD CS2,7qz6lu,I recommend UltraBoost you won‚Äôt regret it. Good luck with ur choice
NMD CS2,7qz6lu,Ultra Boost.
NMD CS2,7qz6lu,I don‚Äôt like the feel of the sharp plug on the CS2s
NMD CS2,7qz6lu,I‚Äôll take any ultraboost over NMDs. 
NMD CS2,7qz6lu,"Okay, thanks!"
NMD CS2,7qz6lu,"Oh, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd actually be able feel it. Thanks, I‚Äôll keep that in mind!"

NMD CS2,8317rn,"Hate the CS2 personally, and I‚Äôve never been a fan of black Boost. Hot pink is also a vile colour imo"
NMD CS2,8317rn,"I concur, but mostly because of the colour hit. "

NMD CS2,72vi7g,Hell yes. I go to BC High and my school colors are Maroon and Gold lol.
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Not a fan of R2 block. Love the look though 
NMD CS2,72vi7g,It‚Äôs a cs2
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Oh god I wish I could justify these rn
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Love the city socks in general
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Why can't we have a burgundy cs2 that is a GR
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Cs1 is still so much nicer of a silhouette then the 2s. The only cs2 that I have liked are the kith ones
NMD CS2,72vi7g,The pattern looks cool but I can't handle R2s
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Is this the Wine Red CS2 from the 'Wine Red' and 'Forest Green' CS's that were announced awhile back?
NMD CS2,72vi7g,"I wouldnt mind if  adidas stopped producing NMDs outside pharrels. With all these other good silhouettes coming out, NMDs seem a bit dated."
NMD CS2,72vi7g,[these were supposed to be a GR](https://i.imgur.com/kiyNVlj.jpg)
NMD CS2,72vi7g,"/u/chinesestirfrank need to cop for romez, reppin that USC colorway"
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Haha I was thinking ASU edition
NMD CS2,72vi7g,"The only version i've liked was the henry poole version of the R2's. The block is too chunky.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/9HdpXAH.jpg) is the only R2 that I really dig, and that's even mostly because it's a much deeper / more subtle red block. I think the black / grey shoe and then the deeper red works. Where as the traditional purpose of the NMD blocks was to add a much more subtle hit of bright color to an otherwise very clean and understated profile / silhouette.

Like one of my favorite NMD's is still the OG with the red and blue lace tips. Small detail but... Just a couple smaller hits of color with the black upper and the white boost midsole. 

When you make that hit of color, a GIANT ass block that takes up like half the heel on the side where it is, it's now kind of going away from what the NMD was, which is like a minimalist shoe that just was styled to be super clean."
NMD CS2,72vi7g,No this is a consortium colab. Looks slightly similar though
NMD CS2,72vi7g,tru /u/_yungjeezy and joseph
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Or FSU
NMD CS2,72vi7g,I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on the college but these are gonna be hot in AZ
NMD CS2,72vi7g,U of minnasota!
NMD CS2,72vi7g,"The bumpers weren't there on OG NMDs to add color, they were there for support. Notice how NMDs don't have heelcups but basically every other boost shoe has some form of one?"
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Slightly? Looks like same shoe üòÇüòÇ
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Or the Washington Redskins
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Close to U of Minnesota colors
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Agreed. /u/wessiide - [this is what I was was talking about](https://twitter.com/theyeezymafia/status/877940399368585216)
NMD CS2,72vi7g,Well shit it does look identical lol I saw this a while back but for some reason it looked different in my mind. There's no way this isn't the same shoe.
NMD CS2,72vi7g,"I guess they decided to slap on consortium, to suck out more money out of us, instead of GR release, because these colourways looks super nice!"
NMD CS2,804obu,"I really like the look of them but when I tried them on, I just couldn't make them look good. They felt good but the pattern made it hard to match clothes with in my opinion"
NMD CS2,804obu,I went TTS to UB sizing and they felt good. I have felt the block in my NMD RY before but it's only after really long walks that I notice it pushing into the side of my foot
NMD CS2,804obu,Idk if adidas is still doing it but I was able to buy my pair on discount because I made a new email account and it took them down to ~$150. I‚Äôm really happy with my purchase they‚Äôre comfy and if you enjoy people who aren‚Äôt into shoes talking about your shoes these will make them do that. 
NMD CS2,804obu,"I love my pair TBH. they fit so nice. 

I got my pair in august last year (the shock pink ones) and they are so fucking nice. so comfy + fit perfect. they work with skinny black jeans so well too.

durability is pretty good too. only problem is boost gets p dirty but i mean thats to be expected.

i barely feel the nmd block and 9/10 i dont notice it unless i try to lol"
NMD CS2,804obu,How is the durability? I'm afraid of getting holes around 2/3 months in
NMD CS2,804obu,This is really comforting. I'm glad you love them so much! Are they TTS for you or did you buy any size higher/smaller?
NMD CS2,804obu,"Sorry, can't help you there. I only wore them once before realizing I didn't like it. Felt like a pk nmd and mine have lasted me a while with no signs of damage. The only way I could see a hole ripping is from your toe if you get it too tight"
NMD CS2,804obu,I‚Äôve had a pair for awhile and if you get the right size and don‚Äôt scape them against anything like concrete you shouldn‚Äôt get holes in them. 
NMD CS2,804obu,"im a size 9 and my cs2s are fine and they fit me really well. Thing is i have weird feet lmao my feet are wide and i have a slight mortons toe.

for reference im a size 10 in my v2 blue tints and they fit really good.

so i would say if you have wide feet perhaps go a size up. i had the chance to try them on and 9.5 fit me better than 9 did

https://imgur.com/a/quO0W pic of mine on feet

you can see my wide ass feet bulging out but not that much lol"
NMD CS2,804obu,"Thanks for the info, really appreciate it! Did the block on the side bother you? I'd consider my feet ""normal"" not too wide or flat etc. You mentioned the shoes feeling good, was it TTS? Or did you have to go 1/2 down/up?"

NMD CS2,6p7d1d,"Compared to other boost shoes, NMD is by far the most uncomfortable. It's not bad, but the other boost shoes blow them out of the water. Vapormax is way more comfy as well"
NMD CS2,6p7d1d,"Can confirm, previous Adidas employee and have worn almost all boost, NMD are by FAR the most uncomfortable boost. Still nice but not nearly as nice as a UB or PB "
NMD CS2,6p7d1d,All depends on if you're walking around or standing around. Ultras send better for moving constantly while nmds and PB make to me are better for standing.

NMD CS2,63s3bb,"There are 2 models in the ""Ronin Pack"", 1 ladies and 1 mens

NMD CS2,63s3bb,Dumb question: what's ADC? 
NMD CS2,63s3bb,"The dots are interesting. If you look closely at the ""laces"", you'll see that the stitching actually goes through the dots. Very nice detail IMO.  
Biggest size is UK8"
NMD CS2,63s3bb,It did
NMD CS2,63s3bb,"The womens pastel colourways are great for a palewave spring/summer vibe though, something that not many mens colourways offer."
NMD CS2,63s3bb,My girl complained bout this as well. I guess everyone in adidas has perfect feet...
NMD CS2,63s3bb,"When I tried the R2's on for the first time, I was really impressed with the improvements they made on the boost, PK, and the sizing. Once I started walking around though, the block on the inside was unbearable for me. It's not EXTREMELY uncomfortable, but it's also not unnoticeable like the R1's. For me, it was a dealbreaker. "
NMD CS2,63s3bb,"had to sell my WM R2's because of that damn block, but i hope they work out for you"
NMD CS2,63s3bb,Is there a difference between the two other than size/shape?
NMD CS2,63s3bb,"On the confirmed app the stripes version is listed as NMD_CS2_PK_W, same as this one. And my voucher says Size 8 US W so idk. Although the polka dot R2 is also listed as NMD_CS2_PK_W so maybe it just got messed up"

NMD CS2,63s3bb,"I guess I'm one of those people that have perfect feet lol, I'm always so confused when people complain about the block on the R2s. But it does suck that it bothers some people though"
NMD CS2,63s3bb,The men's doesn't have polka dots..
NMD CS2,63s3bb,Lol. They dropped 14 different models... it gets super confusing. The ID on these are BA7212. Hope that helps

NMD CS2,7v6q92,"You will love them. Very comfortable. Not sure what you'll be using them for, but for casual pair i love mine. "
NMD CS2,7v6q92,I have them and if I could do it over again I‚Äôd get the R1s with the more white Zebra pattern. Still love them but didn‚Äôt like them AS much as I thought I would.
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"Do they look good? (Will people look at my feet and think, ‚Äúwow‚Äù)

Are they comfy? 

"
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"I‚Äôm getting it for casual too! I shared with my friends and all of them say it doesn‚Äôt look good, but I think it‚Äôs pretty unique/cool and definitely looks dope in person as compared to the pics "
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"personally wouldnt buy them, but its whatever you like bro"
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"Do you think they look good? You're the one that would be wearing them. I can tell you that they definitely `pop' in person - to me anyways. 

I have a pair of R2 PK's and they're really comfy then I added an insole which made them even better. If you have wide feet the block on medial side of the shoe might bother you. "
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"It looks 100x better in person and on foot IMO. Probably the most comfortable shoe in my collection currently. My friend got this zebra colorway and I got black, his zebras seem to be a little looser to me in the heel and ankle, so he wishes he would've half sized down. I went true to size in the black colorway and mine are absolutely perfect. "
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"Yea they are super unique, I‚Äôve never seen one in person before. They look real comfy "
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"What do you have in your collection? I‚Äôm new to collecting, do you have any recommendations? Right now I only own a Nike Flyknit Free RN and it‚Äôs blue haha so I want a casual shoe, a shoe more toned down."
NMD CS2,7v6q92,Btw how do they hold up in the rain? 
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"Well I'm a Lebron fan. So as for shoes I care about I have Lebron 12, 14, 14 low, 15, Soldier 9. Then I have some Air Max 97. Then my Adidas, James Harden Vol 1 LS and the black cs2.

But I'd definitely recommend Lebron 15 and Air Max 97 for casual wear. I'm new to Boost but it easily takes 1st place for comfort. But in my experience Lebrons hold up the longest and are great quality. "
NMD CS2,7v6q92,"I actually wore my cs2 in the rain for the first time last night.. they held up, but i swapped shoes when I got to my car just because I don't trust prime knit getting wet. "
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Wtf when did theae come out
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Mine arrived today. Excited to try them on. I think this is only the second CS2 that I‚Äôve liked. 
NMD CS2,7qwekb,[deleted]
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Do these come with an insole? 
NMD CS2,7qwekb,HOW
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Love this! Shall be my first pair of cs2
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Damn üòçüî•
NMD CS2,7qwekb,TTS? I've heard these run small for people with wide feet
NMD CS2,7qwekb,I posted a link to them when they released online couple weeks back and just got down voted. Sneakers is a fickle community sometimes.
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Been sitting on here http://store.premierboutique.com/NMD-CS2-PK-United-Arrows-Sons-Mens-in-BlackWhite-by-Adidas_p_13768.html
NMD CS2,7qwekb,They got released in a couple of Adidas consortium shops. I managed to pick up mine in a restock from Wish ATL. I just saw that sneakersnstuff is doing their release of this shoe online on January 18th.
NMD CS2,7qwekb,I wasn't really into the City Sock 2 silhouette in general but these shoes changed it for me. They look great and are comfortable.
NMD CS2,7qwekb,No they don't.
NMD CS2,7qwekb,They fit like NMD R1. I got a 1/2 size down.
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Do you mean r1 pk? I usually go 0.5 down for r1 pk but not sure about cs2. 
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Yes pk.
NMD CS2,7qwekb,Thanks. Does it fit the same as r1 pk. Or w extra room without insole?
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,Epic react is better in every category imo
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,those blocks on CS2 bother my feet alot.
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,Cosign.
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,What color way of the Epic Reacts do you recommend? 
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,Could you go a half size up
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,"Wolf grey looks great (love the gum outsole), the cookies and cream colorway is also pretty fire. 

Epic Reacts are better in every way than NMDs."
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,I did NikeID and made my own. They are unique and awesome for 20 extra bucks
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,"half up for wide feet. otherwise don‚Äôt worry about the block, it‚Äôll break in."
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,"They r tts.  If you have narrow feet, u could even go half size down.  Since there's no support on the upper, you don't want it too loose, IMO."
NMD CS2,8uk1o2,Cookies and cream are expensive on goat. Or at least compared to other color ways I like the wolf gray as well
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,I think it‚Äôs pretty normal. Should go away with wears.
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,I have two pairs of cs2‚Äôs and that ‚Äúblock‚Äù has never been a trouble for me
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,Can you elaborate on ‚Äúblock‚Äù
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,"The dots:

http://prntscr.com/hhbr9t http://prntscr.com/hhbrkm "
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,http://prntscr.com/hhbmho this thing
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,have you never had a boost shoe before? they‚Äôre normal 
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,"Those dots are what people refer to as the boost ‚Äúnipples‚Äù which is normal, as for the block, it shouldn‚Äôt really be bothering you at all maybe after a couple wears it‚Äôll go away."
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,"First pair of 'real' sneakers, have worn vans for the last five years :P"
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,"congrats then. as for the block, it‚Äôs at an angle and doesn‚Äôt work for everyone. the CS1 might be your style. "
NMD CS2,7gn8sb,"I really liked the new cs1 goretex since they are waterproof, but they are really expensive, got these for 100 euros."
NMD CS2,9kw52w,Good pickup at an amazing price üî•
NMD CS2,9kw52w,"The white pair of Sashikos went way up within the last week and a half. Like, from 85 to 190 üò®"
NMD CS2,9kw52w,NMD r1? They're going for just $90-100 us on stockx iirc.. im a size us 11 tho. What's your size?
NMD CS2,9kw52w,I‚Äôm a size 12
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,[removed]
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,Goat today is have a cyber Monday sale on yeezys today go check it out 
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,Two words: fuck. yes.
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,I am also thinking about getting some CS2s. Can someone tell me how the sizing is? I‚Äôm an 11.5 in most shoes
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,They were on the search page under the cyber Monday picture they are gone now
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,"Are they supposed to be worn without socks, on that note?"
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,i don‚Äôt see any sales on goat rn
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,Go tts
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,its up to you. i wear them both ways. Summer? no socks/invisox.
NMD CS2,a0zdgt,Lol I already got em. Thanks tho!
NMD CS2,7o5bz9,With some chelsea boot thrown in. What a find!
NMD CS2,7o5bz9,[deleted]
NMD CS2,7o5bz9,The material is called‚Äùburst‚Äù ahahah 
NMD CS2,7ipk3w,yes i got email
NMD CS2,7ipk3w,"yeah, I got the ""Score! We got your order"" email"
NMD CS2,7ipk3w,"Ah, damn, I guess my purchase just didn't go through.
Oh well. "
NMD CS2,69zol4,"With white tennis socks they look like slippers my dad might wear. These are fuego with invisible socks. I love the CS2 design, hope we see a lot of interesting colourways for it"
NMD CS2,69zol4,https://sneakernews.com/2017/03/31/adidas-nmd-city-sock-2-cs2-core-black/
NMD CS2,69zol4,"I cant get into any of the city sock designs, I see so many people enjoying them I feel like I'm supposed to. But I just cant get on board with any of them."
NMD CS2,69zol4,"I love the CS2s tbh, looking to cop a pair of the Pearl Greys when they come out next week!"
NMD CS2,69zol4,37 fire emojis.
NMD CS2,69zol4,"Damn that ""model"" is stretching tf outta that sockliner"
NMD CS2,69zol4,"Gnarly shoes hoping I can cop as well. Not sure how reliable fullress is but this article says May 20
http://www.fullress.com/2017/02/03-adidas-originals-nmd-cs2-pk-city-sock-2-primeknit-core-black-ba7188/"
NMD CS2,69zol4,wow those are really nice
NMD CS2,69zol4,Release Date 20/05 boys and gals
NMD CS2,69zol4,"They're up on the adidas EU sites as of yesterday. Says they drop in 9 days. Since there's usually a 1 day discrepancy between what the site says and what they mean, I'm guessing it'll be on the 20th. Still nothing on the US site though. But the CS1 gum pack didn't show up on the US site until a few days after it showed up on the EU sites, so give it a few days. "
NMD CS2,69zol4,"these are dope as hell i was gonna get the ronins but i guess i'll wait 

anyone know where i could get similar joggers?"
NMD CS2,69zol4,Wack
NMD CS2,69zol4,City socks are terrible just buy some And1s and save a bit of coin
NMD CS2,69zol4,hate the pink and white detailing 
NMD CS2,69zol4,"the CS1 is preferred if you get the ideal size, the burrito style sock lining of the CS2 creates a nice fit, but I prefer the look of the CS1 to the CS2. That's not to say I won't be trying to pick up these when they release."
NMD CS2,69zol4,still no release date :    (
NMD CS2,69zol4,"I initially saw them and thought nah I could never wear them

but now a luv mine"
NMD CS2,69zol4,"Legit like unless you're an actual Japanese ninja, I can't see anyone pulling things off."
NMD CS2,69zol4,Thicc ankles boy
NMD CS2,69zol4,"mate, these joggers can be found in any high street fashion shop. H&M would be your best bet. "
NMD CS2,69zol4,pick up the all black pair that just released if these aren't for you. 
NMD CS2,69zol4,I believe it's coming out on the 20th. Someone on the weekly thread posted a site that shows a huge bunch of NMD's coming on the 20th and the black cs2's are there. 
NMD CS2,69zol4,"Yeah, I love how they look when I see them not on foot but I have yet to see an on foot picture I like."
NMD CS2,69zol4,It's cos people seem to only wear tapered skinny joggers. Personally I wear wide legged flary skate slacks and I think they look clean with anything trouser. The ronins are more difficult that my white gum CS1s. 
NMD CS2,69zol4,"Just need a minimalist fit, I've got a pair of ronins just can't have too much going  on with your outfit and they look nice."
NMD CS2,69zol4,W2c a nigga like that üò©üò©üò©
NMD CS2,69zol4,classic. i should've known. feel like i've seen a million w2c answers on this thread that end up being h&m haha
NMD CS2,69zol4,"I already have the winter wools, want a nice monochrome cs2"
NMD CS2,69zol4,[deleted]
NMD CS2,6jbagz,I like these
NMD CS2,6jbagz,I paid $175 + shipping for these (size 12)
NMD CS2,6jbagz,[deleted]
NMD CS2,6jbagz,Me too thanks
NMD CS2,6jbagz,I'm usually a size 12 and these fit pretty well for me. I've seen some people go half a size down but these are fine. 
NMD CS2,6jbagz,How much?
NMD CS2,6jbagz,Yes?
NMD CS2,6jbagz,i just got mine for 125+ shipping on stockx size 10
NMD CS2,6jbagz,"Lmao my bad, I meant to ask how much for the shoe "
NMD CS2,6jbagz,Wow good deal ! Im trying to get them for 125 also haha
NMD CS2,6jbagz,"I think they're like $150, or so depending on size on goat."
NMD CS2,6jbagz,Cool
NMD CS2,64ruib,"Such a nice sneaker, nice pickup man. Hoping i can cop one soon, enjoy it!"
NMD CS2,64ruib,The sole and the pull tab are my favorite parts of this shoe. 
NMD CS2,64ruib,can someone gimme some sizing info? I enjoy my fit snug. TTS?
NMD CS2,64ruib,"I feel like these are growing on me, but need a super specific pair of pants to get by"
NMD CS2,64ruib,They just restocked all sizes on the Adidas website. At least in europe i know.
NMD CS2,64ruib,"Yea, they're really nice details. 
My initial thought from the pictures was that a gum sole would have been a better fit. But seeing it on feet i really love the ice sole. "
NMD CS2,64ruib,I usually buy UK 11 and i went 10.5 here. They fit perfectly for me. I have however read that a lot go tts since they fit more snug than the cs1.
NMD CS2,64ruib,Any skinny jeans or joggers works for me. No socks and pinrolled jeans look dope.
NMD CS2,64ruib,"own your style man, if you wanna wear them with some suit trousers go for it. "
NMD CS2,64ruib,"Must bw only europe, us site is sold out but im going to the flagship in nyc tomm so maybe they will have a pair!"
NMD CS2,64ruib,I've just bought my pair from the UK restock and followed suit with 0.5 down. Managed to get 20% cashback to offset the fact I couldn't get any immediate student discount in the adidas checkout process. Are they as comfy as UB do you know?
NMD CS2,64ruib,"I was their saturday and they had all sizes still, i got mine online though. Good luck!"
NMD CS2,64ruib,"I dont own a pair of UB so i can't compare them personally. From what i've heard the UB is a lot more comfortable, mainly due to the fact that is has ankle support.
I think the boost on the UB is softer aswell but i could be wrong. "
NMD CS2,64ruib,"Thats awesome, hopefully they have a 12 tomm. How does it fit, tts or did you go up or down?"
NMD CS2,64ruib,I don't know they will be here tmrw. Most people say half a size down if you want snug tts if you want some room. I will let you know will prob post pics on this sub even tho its saturated with them
NMD CS2,64ruib,"I went half a size down and they fit perfectly for me. Just make sure that you have room for an insole - alot of people, myself included, is bothered by the Lego block. I do however have wide feet.
"
NMD CS2,8bu37y,Go up a half size I'd say. I mistakenly purchased a size 9 cs2 and it does not fit well.
NMD CS2,8bu37y,Since ur feet are on the narrow side I would say a half size down ought to fit perfectly..   with the sock like fit going down isn‚Äôt an issue at all(and is actually recommended imo) since urdon‚Äôt have wide feet to push up against the block on the medial outside of the shoe or the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù on the lateral inside of the shoe..      trust me I just went through all of this with the r2‚Äôs and c2‚Äôs...
NMD CS2,836rck,I don't think trying another pair is going to solve the problem. I have the exact same pair and don't wear them because of the fit.
NMD CS2,836rck,"The thing is that the right shoe fits well, why wouldnt the left shoe do it aswell?"
NMD CS2,63ui61,Stitching is üî•
NMD CS2,63ui61,"Love the troll imgur title too, these are fire"
NMD CS2,63ui61,How does CS2 fit?
NMD CS2,63ui61,In love with these. Saw Jaysee had them and can't wait till they release.
NMD CS2,63ui61,It pops so much in person
NMD CS2,63ui61,"I think they're finally getting the hint. Thanks, had em since New Years finally got around to Un-dsing them"
NMD CS2,63ui61,"TTS. Very similar to CS1s but the primeknit definitely feels a little thicker and hugs more. In terms of comfort, blows the CS1 out of the water. Can't wait till the core blacks come out."
NMD CS2,63ui61,How'd you get them if you don't mind me asking? Through a plug or just bought them from someone who had them?
NMD CS2,63ui61,Got em from a guy on grailed for a solid price. I was very hesitant at first given they hadn't been released and I saw some fakes floating the web but had them checked out by an adidas employee with the same sample pair.
NMD CS2,7xrj7j,"Which one do you prefer, this or de NMD x UAS? "
NMD CS2,7xrj7j,These are literally R2s with no laces whereas the CS1s are totally different from the R1s.
NMD CS2,7xrj7j,Personally I like these a lot more because they have a sort of OG colour way whilst the UAS collab is a bit bland 
NMD CS2,7xrj7j,"Pretty much lol, the material is a bit different tho."
NMD CS2,64hgbi,"my ub 3.0s im a 9 and 1 + 2s im a 9.5, i ordered a 9 and i was swimming in em. If you're planning on going without an insole, go 0.5 down but, if you plan on using an insole go TTS"
NMD CS2,64hgbi,I would go TTS. I thought I went .5 down but i just double checked and the fit is perfect. 
NMD CS2,64hgbi,TTS is the way to go 
NMD CS2,64hgbi,"Half down imo if you like a snug PK fit. If you enjoy a lose fit, go TTS. "
NMD CS2,64hgbi,I went TTS and while they are a little loose (I even have a big foot) they are perfectly snug with your own insole
NMD CS2,64hgbi,"I think i'm in a similar situtation as you then, since i'm a 10.5 for 3.0 and 11 for 1 and 2s. I'll see what happens with the 10.5 if it doesn't fit then i'll just put and insole, I do like having extra space in my shoes afterall "
NMD CS2,64hgbi,Keep in mind u cant tighten em like UBs or NMDs so a snug fit is recommended. The cs2 knit isnt super flexible like the 3.0 UB pk but it is still pk.
NMD CS2,64hgbi,"Yeah, I have a feeling it'll be similar to my stan smith pk where it isn't as stretchy. Do you mind showing me an on foot pic of yours? Just wanna see how much toe room there is."
NMD CS2,64hgbi,I'm not currently at home or have em with me but my toe is about the size of your thumb nail (vertically) from the end of the shoe. I put insoles in em and wear all my shoes without socks
NMD CS2,64hgbi,oh that;s good to hear man thanks a lot :D 
NMD CS2,7egf9a,I love my set of laceless too! I signed up for their mailing lists and get a ton of emails with all of their new colorways and releases.
NMD CS2,7egf9a,Do the laceless feel too tight at all? How do they compare to the uncaged?
NMD CS2,7egf9a,"I think I got lucky with the laceless as a size eleven fit me just perfect but from what I read there did seem to be some people going a size up or down. Again, I'm not a sneaker head but the comfort these shoes give me is incredible. "
NMD CS2,7egf9a,Glad you like them man! UB‚Äôs are definitely the most comfortable boost shoe for sure. 
NMD CS2,65abi2,Hope your Friday is good
NMD CS2,65abi2,aye I'm wearin my ronins tmrw(technically today it's 2:30 am)
NMD CS2,65abi2,ID on pants?
NMD CS2,65abi2,"Thanks, have a good one too!"
NMD CS2,65abi2,H&M cotton twill joggers
NMD CS2,5ykalo,How's the sizing
NMD CS2,5ykalo,.5 down
NMD CS2,6md61y,Oh. Damn. These are üî•

NMD CS2,8v5ohl,"found them @ nordstrom rack for $115. theyre slightly roomy, but look pretty nice on feet. want to make sure im not getting robbed. cant seem to find this cw anywhere online"
NMD CS2,8v5ohl,NMD CS2 Primeknit Indigo
NMD CS2,8v5ohl,copped them! got paid today and i liked the way they looked on feet
NMD CS2,8v5ohl,"115 is a good price since retail is 180, never seen those before though so can't help you there"
NMD CS2,8v5ohl,awesome. thanks so much!
NMD CS2,8v5ohl,yeah it was originally marked as $180 but i saw that online at adidas they had a one cw at $95. doesnt look like theyre trying to fleece me though. thanks dude!
NMD CS2,8v5ohl,ofc :)
NMD CS2,7v0g5b,How is the sizing with these? Thinking of getting a pair this weekend
NMD CS2,7v0g5b,"Deffo TTS, I went half up and they fit loose."
NMD CS2,8qbtq8,"Go tts. If they fit a little loose, add an insole as they don‚Äôt come with one "
NMD CS2,8qbtq8,"Gotcha, thanks. The video I watched said go half a size down since they don't have laces (not much you can do about it if they're too big)"
NMD CS2,7q8am9,I‚Äôd like to see this as well.
NMD CS2,7q8am9,Ask in r/sneakerfits! :)
NMD CS2,7q8am9,"Will do, thanks "

Gucci Slide,f4ao14,"And if you do there usually a pair of triple s,s"
Gucci Slide,f4ao14,They‚Äôre Gucci shoes my dude
Gucci Slide,f4ao14,Bruh
Gucci Slide,f4ao14,Those aren't Hilfigers my guy.
Gucci Slide,f4ao14,F
Gucci Slide,f4ao14,Oof
Gucci Slide,7slg4x,Keep some light beaters in your bag or locker and switch into them just for that class. I wouldn‚Äôt wear anything nice to classes with those hazards. I wore my white Undefeated 97s to O Chem lab and regretted it. Never again. 
Gucci Slide,7slg4x,"It‚Äôll work on the canvas part of the slide but if it sets on the inside of the slide they‚Äôll be hard to keep on it‚Äôll make them really slippery, I think in America it‚Äôs okay to wear socks with these though?"
Gucci Slide,7slg4x,"I feel you bro, I try to avoid wearing nice shoes when I have ceramics (on a block schedule), I always take off any jackets or hoodies before class, and I‚Äôm the only kid that wears an apron everyday to cover up whatever shirt I‚Äôm wearing. It‚Äôs a struggle to flex on campus lmao"
Gucci Slide,7slg4x,"Yes wearing socks is very common in the states, thanks man"
Gucci Slide,7slg4x,[deleted]
Gucci Slide,7slg4x,"Damn wish I had an air compressor lmao, sounds like it would work really well now that I think about it "
Gucci Slide,4xx064,"UBs lol, are you nudah or something? needin gucci slides lmao"
Gucci Slide,4xx064,"To answer your question, it honestly depends on what you do more often, walk/run around or fuck other guys' bitches. That's just my two cents mah dude."
Gucci Slide,4xx064,"Ultra Boosts all the way dude, i don't think they are available in my country so don't you fail me and buy some god damn gucci slides !!!"
Gucci Slide,4xx064,"Buy UB's Slides are just dumb in my opinion, if you were to get anything from gucci (I bought a belt) but like buy a belt or one of there sneaker/ loafer"
Gucci Slide,4xx064,Ehm? ...
Gucci Slide,4xx064,yeah get those gucci slides like everyone else. or get those ub's like everyone else. that being said i want kith slides like everyone else
Gucci Slide,4xx064,"I also thought about supreme slides, idk I just think they look cool"
Gucci Slide,4xx064,This guy gets it
Gucci Slide,4xx064,ye?
Gucci Slide,4xx064,I have yet to find a purpose of this response.
Gucci Slide,4xx064,"No hate fam was just making jokes, supreme slides would be dope. UBs are super comfy and fit really nicely"
Gucci Slide,4xx064,"Be a üêë or a üê∂, but if you're willing to give it your all and are prepared for greatness, you can be the üêê"
Gucci Slide,4xx064,Or get UB Slides
Gucci Slide,729kja,I was at the Gucci store the other day getting a purse for my girl. The amount of fuck boys looking at slides was unreal. Please don't be one of them
Gucci Slide,729kja,"Never got the whole Gucci flops thing. If you're gonna buy designer, why not get something they're specialty is in and what they're really known for like Gucci horse-bits or Hermes belts. Not hating; I hope you enjoy them. "
Gucci Slide,729kja,"ah dammit, I'd buy supreme slides but I couldn't find any :P"
Gucci Slide,729kja,i'll probably end up buying more Gucci stuff but I kinda have to flex on a budget rn. gotta save for a house my dude
Gucci Slide,729kja,"Save for a house?

Why even flex then?"
Gucci Slide,729kja,"well not a house, just something to rent for a while after I turn 18."
Gucci Slide,7nla6w,r/fashionreps
Gucci Slide,5bks5j,They have them at barneys and i believe they ship from New York. 
Gucci Slide,5bks5j,Thanks 
Gucci Slide,dc0ijl,"Hawai'i isn't included yet, but the shipping def makes up for it"
Gucci Slide,dc0ijl,It‚Äôs rolling out as each state decides to require it. There was a lawsuit with Wayfair recently that kicked all this off.
Gucci Slide,dc0ijl,"Different states have adopted different tax policies on online purchases at different times, but I believe the majority are taxing now."
Gucci Slide,dc0ijl,"NY had it in April for a short period but then took it off

I hope we‚Äôre not getting it again, and if we do, after Friday lol"
Gucci Slide,dds5vc,"Yea, it‚Äôs called an open unregulated marketplace. 


It sucks to get lowballed, but honestly if you have a price in mind, stay firm. Resellers are just trying to hustle, i dont let it bother me, sometimes making a connection is worth more than the shoes too."
Gucci Slide,dds5vc,"I feel ya. It gets annoying when they low ball so, much then get so rude when you try to work out a deal on one of their sneakers for sale."
Gucci Slide,9izpy3,"I can‚Äôt picture it at all

Can I trouble you for a pic plz?"
Gucci Slide,9izpy3,"I can't find a pic, imagine a dead black slide, and on the part that goes over the foot there was like a drawing/picture of Gucci flip flops"
Gucci Slide,9izpy3,"I googled it. A lot. 

Can‚Äôt find it at all

Well. I hope u find em bro"

Gucci Slide,6mgtlf,The Adidas alphabounce slides are ridiculously comfortable
Gucci Slide,6mgtlf,"Yup, they're really comfortable and comes in a bunch of colours (including id), and they don't cost too much either "
Gucci Slide,6mgtlf,I need something opened toe. I live in Southern California my friend xD 
Gucci Slide,6mgtlf,"Naah.  I've done full leather sneakers in Arizona....

Pick a knitted or canvas shoe and you're good to go.  Sandals are just way gross and unsanitary.  "
Gucci Slide,6mgtlf,"Damn dude, that's crazy.

I do have canvas shoes for spring/summer weather, but I'd also really like something for the beach or just to quickly leave the house for errands/trash. "
Gucci Slide,6niu93,"I would not get the Gucci ones for the actual sand, they will wear away from it."
Gucci Slide,6niu93,Either these http://m.adidas.com/us/adilette-ultra-explorer-slides/AQ5748.html or these bro http://m.adidas.com/us/adilette-ultra-slides/BA9275.html super comfy and stylish imo. I have the gray ones and they're amazing.

Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,Never been a huge fan of the gucci tennis shoes but the balenciaga socks are super clean ngl
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,How do the Balenciaga fit? Are they true to size? I‚Äôm 9.5 us men. Was thinking of copping last month but didn‚Äôt pull the trigger.
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,I love my gg slides pretty much wear them daily. Nice collection üëçüèª
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,I notice you have the black smudges or maybe its the paint scraped off on the gucci slides.. I have a pair of gucci slides as well and I have a few of those as well. anyone know how to get them off (if possible) or what i can do to make them look good again?
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,"It‚Äôs crazy how this sub doesn‚Äôt like things like this.

 If you have something like Gucci X Fila collaboration, everyone will love it."
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,[deleted]
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,Thanks man. Go for it and you won't regret it
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,I love them
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,Thanks bro
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,They are tts for me. I am a size 11.5 US and a 45 fits me perfectly
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,Thanks bro those are my dailys too haha
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,"It's the paint scraping off, you can remove the rubber scuffs with a magic eraser but you can't do anything about the paint being scraped off. It kinda sucks"

Would you prefer Louis Vuitton x Skechers?"
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,It's weird. Some places say different things
Gucci Slide,gnzdsy,"Yeah, it‚Äôs really annoying. I have to rely on what the actual cm they give, but shoe manufacturers don‚Äôt give af about that either, lol."
Gucci Slide,d69035,"Double flex, probably another flex on the wrist too."
Gucci Slide,d69035,"Dude, all over your posts are top notch. Where them Gucci slides at though?"

Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,Looks like NIKECRAFT just added 13 days to the countdown timer. 
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"Anyone else been watching nikecraft.com the last few days, first it started with 3 days then added another and now 13 days have been added, are they for real. Tom Sachs said on instagram that the release would be July 13th"
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"So my Kith New Balances just arrived from dsm and not only did they come in a regular cardboard box, they didn't bother sending me the interchangeable Ns either. They'll apparently send them to me when they get them in from Kith, but something tells me I'm not ever going to get them."
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"Saw a picture of some Boost Slides on twitter and they looked comfy as hell. Anybody have any info on when they drop?

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEWdCKoVYAAqcwr.jpg:large"
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"Did anyone cop Tyler the Creator x Converse?  How stupid of me to think that I could've gotten it manual, bots ate that up in milliseconds..."
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,Honest question. What's so appealing about the multi UB? Do they look really good in person or something? 
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,is anyone else excited for the tyler x converse one star
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,TF happened with tyler & converse drop on nike?
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"Got a manual W on the Tyler the Creator x Converse through nike, hopefully i don't get a cancellation email"
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"The Adidas Ultraboost 3.0 multicolor is the shoe I've been waiting for. Any advice on making sure I get these when they drop?

Edit: I got them! Thank you, u/afatgreekcat and u/wannagotopopeyes for all your help. Only other pair I've ever wanted (and still do) are my grails (Nike what the dunk SB)."
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,White laceless ultraboost released in a french site :  http://hubbastille.com/le-studio-tech/366-ultra-boost-laceless.html
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"Random thoughts: The Kith 574s weren't a complete sell out, and they had a decent size run left for a while before the entire page was pulled (weird) wonder how easy itll be get these for retail or under in the next couple months.."
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,will the multicolor 3.0's restock in canada? the original release said west europe only
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"Anyone still trying for MC, download the Finishline app. easy cart on it. "
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,This Mars Yard release is becoming too stressful yo. I just want clear info üò≠üò≠
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"Not sure if many will be able to take advantage, but if you have an American Express CC look at your offers. I have a new one for $10 off $50+ at Nike."
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"I just got a Converse email. Says the Tylers were limited to 100 pairs. Explains a bit, but where's the golf drop?"
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,Anyone liking the new balance 574s? Also what is sizing like for the normal 574's? Just so i know what to get 
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,Tyler x Converse instantly sold out on the golfwang site too. feelsbadman.
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,does everyone want to get a pair of Multi UB? Are they gonna sit ?
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,The Tyler x Converse appeared for a second on the Golf site but disappeared... They gone???
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,Anyone know of a restock of the Converse/Tyler shoe?
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,The New Balance 574s costs $120. So did kith and dsm really charge us $60 more for some extra logo patches?
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,Both of my miadidas have gone to design! Cannot wait!
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,My UBs are in productionüëç
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"I have a gift card for FTL, should I try copping the multis online or in store?"
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,Anyone else notice yeezy cream prices just keep dropping? Seen local sellers trying to offload size 8.5-10 pairs for $380-400
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,Anyone else staying up tonight to try to cop MC on ADC? 
Gucci Slide,6mcoo2,"Never shopped on ADC, do I need to refresh the page on the adidas multi color once the timer ticks down to 0? Or will it automatically refresh?"
Gucci Slide,dyvods,A day or two.
Gucci Slide,dyvods,"Just happened to me. Previous sells have taken a few hours, but this last one took 3 days to get reviewed."
Gucci Slide,dyvods,"Don‚Äôt sell on Goat!!! They just stole my shoe!!! I sold a brand new Gucci slide to them and they switched it to a used basketball shoe and tell me I need to get it back!!! No customer service replied to me ! 
My friend meets the same problem. He sold a 1‚Äôs and Goat haven‚Äôt sent him credits for two weeks.

Be careful! Do not use Goat"
Gucci Slide,dyvods,"Damn, i took down the listing because i thought something was wrong and now i gotta wait again üòì"
Gucci Slide,dyvods,Pretty frustrating when these travis 6s have dropped in value like a hundred dollars in a few days
Gucci Slide,dyvods,"Thats crazy bro, I‚Äôve sold on goat plenty of times with no problems until this review thing. Id wither contact your bank or threaten a lawsuit"
Gucci Slide,dyvods,Patience
Gucci Slide,dyvods,I don‚Äôt know what to do now as a seller. I sent them my shoes without protection
Gucci Slide,dyvods,You have proof through email of what you sold and how much they sold for. That should be all you need
Gucci Slide,dyvods,Yes I have them. Also the UPS receipt. Who should I report to? PayPal will help me ?
Gucci Slide,dyvods,The BBB or FTC should be able to direct you where to go from there
Gucci Slide,dyvods,Thank you. I know this would be hard... I just suggest you not to sell on Goat because my friends and I got scammed by Goat.
Gucci Slide,dyvods,Problem is stockx isnt any better üòê
Gucci Slide,dyvods,"If you sell on these platform, you‚Äôre not covered. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You have to pray for good luck"
Gucci Slide,dyvods,Goat just admitted they got my Gucci slide but they still consigned the basketball shoe that doesn‚Äôt belong to me... and they marked the issue solved. Ridiculous
Gucci Slide,dyvods,You get your money at least?
Gucci Slide,dyvods,No

Gucci Slide,asrjxg,All gucci
Gucci Slide,asrjxg,Foreal I love my moccasins

Gucci Slide,7um6s8,Wearing my Oreo's now. One of my favorite shoes. 
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,how do you lace your v2s like that? everytime i try to lace my core reds like that they end up being too long :(
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,"I really dig those Vans Authentic‚Äôs on the far right, what are they?"
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,BBB slides > Gucci slides
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,Ofwgkta
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,"Not OP, but have them and the candy floss ones and soles are great IMO. Find them super comfortable, for me I like them similar to Ultraboost for immediate comfort (not for long days and shit though)  

If you a wide foot boi you will have a rough time though, super slim."
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,"Wanted them since I ever laid my eyes upon them, luckily I bought these while Zumiez had them on sale in like the fall of 2016 although I had to go up half a size since they didn't have my size on there!"
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,Me too!
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,They‚Äôre really comfortable! 
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,Def my fav V2 colour way
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,"I ""undo"" (for the lack of a better term) every line of holes except the very first line near the toes, then I just wear em like that. I get the ends of the laces to a good enough length then I start undoing the rest of the lines"
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,Had to go back far in my email to check but it just says they are Baja Authentic‚Äôs! 
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,LaVar wears BBB slides when he‚Äôs schooling MJ
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,I have wide feet so these aren‚Äôt the best for me but they‚Äôre still not that bad
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,"Not imo, they're straight rubber under your foot. Only good for the flex."
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,Thanks man. ‚Äòpreciate it. Theyre dope! I may have to cop a pair.
Gucci Slide,7um6s8,"Surprising (and cool) to hear they aren't that bad, couple friends of mine have pretty wide feet and can't fit in these at all without having them be really long on them."

Gucci Slide,6917ii,They're absolutely in my rotation lmao
Gucci Slide,6917ii,I love my Gucci slides. So fresh
Gucci Slide,6917ii,I had to buy the human races for resale but I got a real good price on em
Gucci Slide,6917ii,Adidas Human Race NMD
Gucci Slide,6917ii,They're pretty decent. I think they'd be more comfy if I ordered the right size but they're a little tight on me
Gucci Slide,6917ii,Yea. $190+tax made it a little over $200
Gucci Slide,6917ii,I need more AJ1s in my collection. I'm sad I took an L on the Royals. But at least I got a W on the yeezys
Gucci Slide,6917ii,"True, that's like me. I don't have a lot of sneakers (10 pairs, nothing hyped) over a year and a half of being on /r/sneakers and caring about them. Be sure to definitely get some basics, though, like vans or smth"
Gucci Slide,6917ii,Are these are retail pick ups?
Gucci Slide,6917ii,"Nice, what did you get em for if you dont mind me asking"
Gucci Slide,6917ii,i feel ya. They look so dope but i just cant convince myself to spend so much on flops
Gucci Slide,6917ii,Wow that's crazy
Gucci Slide,6917ii,"Yea I'm gonna cop some classic converse chucks and a basic pair of vans. I'm also trying to cop the Human Race Tennis or whatever. The ones that looks like Stan Smiths, this Pharrell and adidas collab releasing Saturday "

Gucci Slide,6aw28r,They're definitely scuffs from rubbing them together when walking. The same thing happens to NMDs' back 'heel cup'
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,"I can't tell if they're scratched from the slides rubbing together when you walk(I'm not saying you do, but it's possible). Or if the material is flexing. "
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,"Just put them in the bin, they're horrible. "
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,"Yo I own a pair. 

This is normal. Magic eraser can help. But it's normal wear. "
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,I'm not usually a complainer but $200 for slides is a lite steep but I didn't expect this to happen. Is there anyway o fix this? Idk what it is I wore them one day around the house and they started to and then eventually got worse as the day went on and I went and grabbed food and came back and they were like this. 
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,This is very strange. Are you sure they're not fakes?
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,That's what I thought but I honestly at no point today could've scratched them against anything
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,"I own these. I got a really good deal from a friend and couldn't say no.

It's purely label. My $30 nikes blow em out of the water in terms of comfort. "
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,"I haven't had enough time with them to say the durability besides the paint, but they're moderately comfy. My reason of buying is because I'll wear the same pair of slides every day in the summer and I will buy acg sneakerboots for $200 for the winter so spending $200 for a summer shoe/sandal I'll wear every day was appropriate because I like these a lot & I'll spend the same on a pair of shoes I'll wear less "
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,"I didn't think about that, honestly it very well could be that, but I've never experienced that problem before"
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,Paint over them maybe? I don't know just a suggestion.

Gucci Slide,6aw28r,Idk man. It looks like Ub cage scratches where you can't get them out. 
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,I can get behind that.  'Grats on the pickup and hope you get that scuff issue sorted!
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,"I looked at the photos again, and they look like scuffs. "
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,"Try taking an eraser to them and see what happens.

If not try a Magic Eraser I guess?"
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,That going to make it worst 
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,[got those too](https://imgur.com/a/3EODs) but on the outside not the inside
Gucci Slide,6aw28r,Damn that sucks
Gucci Slide,5lvxnl,gucci slide tho!! what's your honest take on them compared to adidas or nike slides? comfort and fitment and stuff
Gucci Slide,5lvxnl,"Dr. Doom's, Metallic 5's, and all those damn Kobe 11's are so sick."
Gucci Slide,5lvxnl,"Red horse Kobe's are fire, nice collection man"
Gucci Slide,5lvxnl,I've honestly never owned Nike or adidas slides I went from the Walmart ones to these haha I like em tho they fit good 
Gucci Slide,6o0o9b,"Adidas adilette Supercloud Plus Slides. $35
Comfort is miles better than any other slides I've ever worn or tried on, and yes they can get wet."
Gucci Slide,6o0o9b,Adidas and Nike are the most common and I'm pretty sure the water isn't a problem with them either 
Gucci Slide,6o0o9b,Under Armour surprisingly 
Gucci Slide,6o0o9b,Thanks!
